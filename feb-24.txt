00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,320 [Speaker 0]
Okay. Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. We
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,400 [Speaker 0]
will call the meeting of February 24th
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,740 [Speaker 0]
to order,
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,520 [Speaker 0]
and, uh, let's, uh, turn off our phones,
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,760 [Speaker 0]
make sure they're on vibrate so we don't
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,440 [Speaker 0]
disrupt the meeting. And remember, we, we
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,520 [Speaker 0]
don't clap here. You can do happy hands if
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,920 [Speaker 0]
you would like. Um, with that being said,
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,420 [Speaker 0]
we will do the Pledge of Allegiance.
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,780 [Speaker 0]
Council Member Negrete, would you like to
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,620 [Speaker 0]
lead us in that?
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,900 [Speaker 0]
And, uh, Council Member Hall, would you
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,700 [Speaker 0]
like to read the, uh, land
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,589 [Speaker 0]
acknowledgement?
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,840 [Speaker 1]
The city of Santa Monica is located on the
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,500 [Speaker 1]
land of Tovaangar. With great respect,
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,600 [Speaker 1]
the city acknowledges the
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,629 [Speaker 1]
Gabrielino-Tongva as the first people of
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,820 [Speaker 1]
this ancestral and unceded territory of
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,100 [Speaker 1]
Owanda, a village that we know as Santa
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,370 [Speaker 1]
Monica. We honor their elders, past and
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,400 [Speaker 1]
present, and the Gabrielino descendants
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,020 [Speaker 1]
who are part of the Gabrielino-Tongva
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,900 [Speaker 1]
tribes. We recognize that these peoples
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,290 [Speaker 1]
are still here, and as settlers and kuyam,
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,020 [Speaker 1]
or guests, we recognize our
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,840 [Speaker 1]
responsibility and obligation to care for
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,100 [Speaker 1]
their land in partnership with them. The
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,730 [Speaker 1]
city of Santa Monica commits to work in
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,340 [Speaker 1]
partnership with the Gabrielino-Tongva
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,180 [Speaker 1]
people to uplift their voices and
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,740 [Speaker 1]
visibility on their ancestral land.
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,040 [Speaker 0]
Phenomenal. Um, Madam Clerk?
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,720 [Speaker 2]
Council Member Negrete?
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,420 [Speaker 3]
Here.
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,550 [Speaker 2]
Council Member Hall?
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,140 [Speaker 1]
Present.
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,380 [Speaker 2]
Council Member Raskin?
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,500 [Speaker 4]
Here.
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,960 [Speaker 2]
Council Member Snell?
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,960 [Speaker 5]
Here.
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,710 [Speaker 2]
Council Member Zarnowskyja?
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,600 [Speaker 6]
Here.
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,820 [Speaker 2]
Mayor Pro Tem Zwick?
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,420 [Speaker 4]
Here.
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,510 [Speaker 2]
And Mayor Terrosis.
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,400 [Speaker 0]
Here.
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,160 [Speaker 2]
Okay, so
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,200 [Speaker 2]
let me ask, are there any council members
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,580 [Speaker 2]
who will be recusing themselves from items
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,060 [Speaker 2]
on the agenda pursuant to the Levine Act?
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,880 [Speaker 2]
None?
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,940 [Speaker 0]
Great. Um, so in terms of agenda
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,200 [Speaker 0]
management, I would be asking for, uh, a
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,680 [Speaker 0]
motion to move the closed session to the
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,380 [Speaker 0]
end of the meeting so that we can hear all
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,020 [Speaker 0]
the items before we adjourn to closed
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,200 [Speaker 0]
session. And I would also just note that
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060 [Speaker 0]
item twelve A has been removed from the
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,440 [Speaker 0]
agenda, so if you're here to comment on
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,300 [Speaker 0]
twelve A, that will not be heard tonight.
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,320 [Speaker 3]
So moved. And I have-- Can I ask a
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,740 [Speaker 3]
question? Are we gonna continue to move it
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,530 [Speaker 3]
all the time to the... We proposed the
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,100 [Speaker 3]
item, and I'm just curious, are we gonna
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,910 [Speaker 3]
keep doing agenda management?
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,980 [Speaker 0]
I think we're waiting to hear back from-
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,200 [Speaker 3]
Okay.
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,530 [Speaker 0]
-the staff.
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,860 [Speaker 3]
Just for the public, that's all. That's
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,360 [Speaker 3]
why I was asking.
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,320 [Speaker 4]
I'll second that.
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,850 [Speaker 0]
Okay, great. And then, um,
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,260 [Speaker 0]
I, uh... Yeah, that's, that's great. Well-
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,510 [Speaker 1]
Would the maker and seconder, uh,
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,980 [Speaker 1]
uh, accept a friendly amendment to include
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,940 [Speaker 1]
waiving the rules to receive three
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,820 [Speaker 1]
commendations?
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,600 [Speaker 0]
Yes. Sorry, I was about to say that.
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,680 [Speaker 6]
Yes.
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,520 [Speaker 0]
Um, yes.
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,710 [Speaker 3]
Yes.
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,710 [Speaker 4]
Yes.
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,080 [Speaker 6]
Yes.
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840 [Speaker 2]
Okay, we need to a voice vote on that. All
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,800 [Speaker 2]
in favor?
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,020 [Speaker 3]
Aye.
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,030 [Speaker 4]
Aye.
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,030 [Speaker 6]
Aye.
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,030 [Speaker 0]
Aye.
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,260 [Speaker 2]
Any opposed? Okay.
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,960 [Speaker 0]
Great, um, so we will now move on to
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200 [Speaker 0]
general public input and comment on
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,380 [Speaker 0]
special agenda items. We have, uh, seven
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,600 [Speaker 0]
speakers, so if you're here for item one,
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,200 [Speaker 0]
I'm gonna call you up, but you can just
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,800 [Speaker 0]
come up and state your name when you're,
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,580 [Speaker 0]
when you're called. Andrea Mick, or just
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,180 [Speaker 0]
Andrea MC, Morgan Hunter Gross, Jerry
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280 [Speaker 0]
Rubin, Jonathan Foster, Lawrence Cohen, if
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,420 [Speaker 0]
you could just, uh, queue up. Thank you.
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,960 [Speaker 7]
Okay. You can go ahead and start speaking.
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,960 [Speaker 7]
Okay, um, I wanted to honor my ADA
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280 [Speaker 7]
rights. Um, people who are disabled don't
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,680 [Speaker 7]
always look that way. But I have epilepsy,
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,040 [Speaker 7]
and, um, I need my ADA rights sometimes
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,080 [Speaker 7]
adhered to, but neither here nor there. My
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,870 [Speaker 7]
name is Andrea McPherson, a resident of
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,500 [Speaker 7]
s- the city of Santa Monica for almost ten
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,400 [Speaker 7]
years. I had to wait in between refills
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,790 [Speaker 7]
for my epilepsy meds, and I had a seizure
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,730 [Speaker 7]
in the city of Long Beach. I was placed on
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,490 [Speaker 7]
my back in the ambulance, placed in
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,660 [Speaker 7]
restraints and given a sedative while
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,000 [Speaker 7]
choking on my own blood and gasping for
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,930 [Speaker 7]
air. I was placed in the ICU in Long
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,740 [Speaker 7]
Beach, and, um, because my lungs were full
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,310 [Speaker 7]
of blood, and, um,
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,850 [Speaker 7]
given the wrong epilepsy meds. After that
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,100 [Speaker 7]
extenuating circumstance, I'm here to
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,500 [Speaker 7]
focus on the positive, like, one, of
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,780 [Speaker 7]
course, um, training all EMT staff that
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,440 [Speaker 7]
epileptic patients need to be on their
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,860 [Speaker 7]
sides. And then, two, um, ID bracelets,
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,140 [Speaker 7]
necklaces, key chains to identify people
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,440 [Speaker 7]
with chronic illnesses by name, emergency
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,540 [Speaker 7]
contact, uh, doctor's contact info, and
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,210 [Speaker 7]
chronic, chronic illness in itself with
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,260 [Speaker 7]
the medications. That would be great to
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,680 [Speaker 7]
work with someone who, um, directly could
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,760 [Speaker 7]
have, uh, key chains and just different
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,360 [Speaker 7]
things like that for children, for
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,980 [Speaker 7]
seniors, and for the disabled, um, for the
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,380 [Speaker 7]
city of Santa Monica to make your
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,120 [Speaker 7]
residents safe. Thank you.
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,880 [Speaker 0]
Thank you, ma'am. Morgan Hunter Gross.
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,070 [Speaker 1]
Good evening, Mayor, City Council members,
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,840 [Speaker 1]
and city staff. Thank you, Mayor, for
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,420 [Speaker 1]
your office hours. It was really something
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,620 [Speaker 1]
special. My name is Morgan Hunter Gross.
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,860 [Speaker 1]
I wanna start with one idea: everything is
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,940 [Speaker 1]
linked. The problems in cities with
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,580 [Speaker 1]
parks, homelessness, public health,
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,300 [Speaker 1]
safety, infrastructure are not separate
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,160 [Speaker 1]
buckets. They are one system: water,
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,040 [Speaker 1]
power, communications, waste, mobility,
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,120 [Speaker 1]
health, and human dignity moving through
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,260 [Speaker 1]
the same space. And here's the educational
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,700 [Speaker 1]
piece. Even the beach sand under our feet
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,680 [Speaker 1]
isn't natural. We engineered and built
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,060 [Speaker 1]
the wide beach out of desert resort sand.
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,070 [Speaker 1]
We repeatedly replenish our beaches with
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,040 [Speaker 1]
millions of cubic yards of imported sand
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,430 [Speaker 1]
over the decades, nineties and even
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,310 [Speaker 1]
earlier, in the mid-nineties even. And
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,060 [Speaker 1]
yet, we still don't have a clean and
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,969 [Speaker 1]
respectful way for people to wash off and
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,280 [Speaker 1]
change clothes. We still lack basic runoff
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,010 [Speaker 1]
capture so that the beach ends up holding
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,200 [Speaker 1]
soap, trash, and w- waste. It reminds me
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,940 [Speaker 1]
that when systems aren't designed end to
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600 [Speaker 1]
end, pollution and harm can accumulate,
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,540 [Speaker 1]
like the PFAS firefighting foams and
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,960 [Speaker 1]
runoff that have been a concern at Santa
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,420 [Speaker 1]
Monica Airport. That's a sign we're
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,520 [Speaker 1]
missing basic systems thinking. We could
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,860 [Speaker 1]
open innovation overlay zones. Beach X
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,060 [Speaker 1]
Santa Monica would be an example, would be
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,900 [Speaker 1]
respected. Modern beach rest stop for
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840 [Speaker 1]
road trippers and aero trippers that makes
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,180 [Speaker 1]
equal, eq- equity visible as
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,040 [Speaker 1]
infrastructure and a model other coastal
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,220 [Speaker 1]
cities can copy. Rapid prototyping,
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,140 [Speaker 1]
crowdsource design, measurable iteration.
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,900 [Speaker 1]
Santa Monica is a living lab, proving new
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,040 [Speaker 1]
designs, toughest real-world conditions,
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,500 [Speaker 1]
the coast, the crowds, and real human
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240 [Speaker 1]
need, while piloting water capture,
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,960 [Speaker 1]
filtration, renewable power from waves,
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,630 [Speaker 1]
wind, and sun. With autonomy and
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,260 [Speaker 1]
accessibility, innovations for human
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060 [Speaker 1]
hygiene and dignity. That's why, in my
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,500 [Speaker 1]
mind, Santa Monica Airport and Santa
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,370 [Speaker 1]
Monica Beach are one quarter, one path,
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,320 [Speaker 1]
and one solution. The airport is already a
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,290 [Speaker 1]
test bed. The beach, pier, breakwaters
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,200 [Speaker 1]
could be a test bed for new technologies,
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,400 [Speaker 1]
and when we connect them, then Santa
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,350 [Speaker 1]
Monica becomes a rare place where we can
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,940 [Speaker 1]
lead in education and real-world
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,420 [Speaker 1]
innovation, starting with the simplest
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,500 [Speaker 1]
human need, a clean and dignified way to
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,120 [Speaker 1]
get clean.
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,880 [Speaker 8]
... We can do better. We need private
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,120 [Speaker 8]
showers, hot water, and proper water
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760 [Speaker 8]
handling techniques. A respected public
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,349 [Speaker 8]
system that residents, both visitors and
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,220 [Speaker 8]
house- in-house neighbors can both use.
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,070 [Speaker 8]
Nice facilities will also help the
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,400 [Speaker 8]
facility. When people get clean, they can
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,040 [Speaker 8]
charge up comfortably. They'll stay in
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,519 [Speaker 8]
Santa Monica, they'll shop and dine
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,110 [Speaker 8]
instead of leaving wet and salty. Thank
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,000 [Speaker 8]
you.
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,740 [Speaker 9]
Thank you. Uh, Jerry Rubin, Jonathan
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,980 [Speaker 9]
Foster, Lawrence Cohen, Samantha Mota.
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,680 [Speaker 10]
Uh, thank you very, very much. Uh, Jerry
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,580 [Speaker 10]
Rubin, Santa Monica, Mayor Toroses, Mayor
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,240 [Speaker 10]
Pro Tem Zwick, honorable council members,
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,300 [Speaker 10]
city staff, city attorney, city manager,
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,700 [Speaker 10]
city clerk, wonderful police officers, and
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,120 [Speaker 10]
fellow Santa Monicans. First of all,
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440 [Speaker 10]
I just want to say thank you for doing the
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,020 [Speaker 10]
closed session at the end of the meeting,
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,880 [Speaker 10]
'cause I know there's no perfect time,
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,680 [Speaker 10]
and I know it's hard either way and how
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,940 [Speaker 10]
unpredictable it is.
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,520 [Speaker 10]
But I just wanna say
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,060 [Speaker 10]
thank you for your dedication. I could go
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,770 [Speaker 10]
home and relax, but you might have to stay
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,760 [Speaker 10]
another hour and a half or two hours, and
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,879 [Speaker 10]
I hope people understand the hard work
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,870 [Speaker 10]
the council's putting in. The next thing I
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,180 [Speaker 10]
w- just wanna say is, and I guess I'm
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,420 [Speaker 10]
saying this, uh, and I said it before,
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,440 [Speaker 10]
we're gonna have a very large, peaceful
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,320 [Speaker 10]
protest on March 28th, and the police are
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,090 [Speaker 10]
commending everyone in Santa Monica, and
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,730 [Speaker 10]
we're commending them for the hard work
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,790 [Speaker 10]
they're gonna be doing.
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,090 [Speaker 10]
Please get involved. Come out with your
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,500 [Speaker 10]
family to the Palisades Park at eleven AM
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,400 [Speaker 10]
at Montana and Ocean Av- Avenue. Bring
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,860 [Speaker 10]
your family. There's, uh... Go to
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,430 [Speaker 10]
nokings.org, and you'll see all the things
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,540 [Speaker 10]
that we're doing to promote extra safety
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,970 [Speaker 10]
and cooperation. But come out, and let's
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,660 [Speaker 10]
make it the largest ever. I mean,
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,880 [Speaker 10]
all I can say is thank you for your
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,660 [Speaker 10]
dedication, and on with the meeting.
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,100 [Speaker 9]
Thank you. Mr. Foster.
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,860 [Speaker 11]
Uh, whose is this? Is this, uh... Okay.
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,810 [Speaker 11]
Hello, Jonathan Foster. I said I would,
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,060 [Speaker 11]
uh, speak about Jerry Rubin. He did a
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,640 [Speaker 11]
vigil for Renee Good, uh, ramming the ICE,
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,620 [Speaker 11]
uh, with a SUV, and that's, that's kinda
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,680 [Speaker 11]
nice, I guess. Uh, I feel that way in
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,620 [Speaker 11]
general about citizens. Uh, she's a pretty
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,260 [Speaker 11]
misled person. Uh, I was wondering if he
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,860 [Speaker 11]
was going to do a vigil for Jamil Shaw
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,420 [Speaker 11]
Jr., shot in the face by a dreamer, Pedro
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,050 [Speaker 11]
Espinoza,
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,700 [Speaker 11]
2008,
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,640 [Speaker 11]
or if he was gonna do a vigil for the
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,960 [Speaker 11]
recent murder by an illegal alien. Brian
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,360 [Speaker 11]
Rodriguez killed eight-year-old
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,760 [Speaker 11]
Aria Asencio. Her dad is active duty
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,360 [Speaker 11]
Marine
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,240 [Speaker 11]
Oscar Asencio, and they had to amputate
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,580 [Speaker 11]
his leg. He's pretty much, you know, brain
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,140 [Speaker 11]
dead. Not, not brain dead, but he's got
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,760 [Speaker 11]
major brain injuries and incoherent. His
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,620 [Speaker 11]
two kids are completely shaken up, two
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,670 [Speaker 11]
sons. His wife's foot's broken, had a, a,
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,720 [Speaker 11]
a contusion, a break. I think that's the
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,140 [Speaker 11]
right word. His wife's hurt pretty
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,160 [Speaker 11]
badly. They, they might be mentioned today
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,020 [Speaker 11]
at the State of the Union. And this, this
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,160 [Speaker 11]
whole embodiment in California that says
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,920 [Speaker 11]
illegal aliens should be able to stay
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,020 [Speaker 11]
here, the sanctuary state crap, your
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,350 [Speaker 11]
daughters should die. You should have your
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,120 [Speaker 11]
leg amputated. You should have brain
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,700 [Speaker 11]
injuries, and then we should arrest you
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,080 [Speaker 11]
and prosecute you and sentence you to jail
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,940 [Speaker 11]
for life. Why his daughter? It should
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,760 [Speaker 11]
have been your daughters, and really, no
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,570 [Speaker 11]
one should be dying from people not
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,350 [Speaker 11]
lawfully permitted in the USA at all.
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,310 [Speaker 11]
This is several police officers shot by
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600 [Speaker 11]
illegal aliens, and nobody seems to care
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,060 [Speaker 11]
at all about a single police officer but
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,840 [Speaker 11]
Jonathan, the chief of police. I ran
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,060 [Speaker 11]
against Donald John Trump because he won't
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,820 [Speaker 11]
arrest the state of California. I
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840 [Speaker 11]
would've already arrested this place,
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,160 [Speaker 11]
would be arrested. You seven would be in
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,920 [Speaker 11]
prison. I would have you all locked up.
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,020 [Speaker 11]
You people are disgusting. The people that
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,720 [Speaker 11]
do this is disgusting.
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,920 [Speaker 9]
Okay, Lawrence Cohen, Samantha Mota, Bryce
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,800 [Speaker 9]
Cooper, and Joe DeRosa.
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,420 [Speaker 9]
Mr., um, Cohen, before you come up, I know
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,979 [Speaker 9]
you have a, you have a-- Do you have a
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,099 [Speaker 9]
video also?
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,159 [Speaker 12]
I do have a video.
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,560 [Speaker 9]
Okay.
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:02,450 [Speaker 12]
Uh, can you see me?
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:02,770 [Speaker 9]
Okay.
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,460 [Speaker 12]
Can you hear me?
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,000 [Speaker 9]
Yes. Oh.
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,320 [Speaker 12]
I can't hear myself. I forgot to wear my
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,140 [Speaker 12]
hearing aids. Um, I'm feeling very
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,840 [Speaker 12]
emotional standing here tonight. Right
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,220 [Speaker 12]
now, in DC, Epstein survivors are at the
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,180 [Speaker 12]
State of the Union,
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,120 [Speaker 12]
and on April 12th,
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,180 [Speaker 12]
we are going to do the world's first event
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,420 [Speaker 12]
to stand for survivors, to celebrate
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,920 [Speaker 12]
their courage, their resilience. It's
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,340 [Speaker 12]
gonna happen here in Santa Monica, and I'd
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,330 [Speaker 12]
like to see how this all started by
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,050 [Speaker 12]
directing your attention to the screen,
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,420 [Speaker 12]
please.
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,640 [Speaker 12]
Th-
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,680 [Speaker 8]
Hi, my name is Summer Willis. When I was
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,690 [Speaker 8]
nineteen years old, I was sexually
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,580 [Speaker 8]
assaulted, and I stayed silent for a
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,280 [Speaker 8]
decade. But when I turned twenty-nine, I
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,340 [Speaker 8]
decided to run twenty-nine marathons,
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,900 [Speaker 8]
and in doing those runs, I found my
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,840 [Speaker 8]
strength, my resilience, and community,
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,160 [Speaker 8]
and that is exactly what we're hoping to
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,220 [Speaker 8]
do with the dinner runs this April during
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,740 [Speaker 8]
Sexual Assault Awareness Month in Santa
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,400 [Speaker 8]
Monica. Can't wait to see you all there.
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,920 [Speaker 12]
And, and what Summer didn't say in that
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,040 [Speaker 12]
video, when we first started working
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,270 [Speaker 12]
together, she was shy. She could barely
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,660 [Speaker 12]
get a word out, and after she finished
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,220 [Speaker 12]
those twenty-nine marathons, uh, she
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,600 [Speaker 12]
rallied the support of Texas legislators
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,600 [Speaker 12]
to adopt the first law in Texas history
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,240 [Speaker 12]
to, uh, define consent
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,160 [Speaker 12]
for people who've been sexually assaulted.
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,120 [Speaker 12]
So it's a miracle if I, if-
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,953 [Speaker 13]
... she knew then what I know n- now about
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:49,044 [Speaker 13]
her. Uh, it's just been quite a
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:51,874 [Speaker 13]
miraculous journey. So a, a few things I
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,504 [Speaker 13]
wanna say. Well, I have eighteen seconds.
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,944 [Speaker 13]
One, I wanna thank the Laemmle theaters,
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,084 [Speaker 13]
'cause they're giving us a, um, a minute
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:01,394 [Speaker 13]
and a half of screen time for every movie
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,204 [Speaker 13]
for the month leading up to our event.
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:07,324 [Speaker 13]
Two, we just got the support of a, um, a
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:11,024 [Speaker 13]
major social media influencer, 2.2 million
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,524 [Speaker 13]
followers. She's coming now.
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,324 [Speaker 14]
Fantastic. Thank you. Um, Samantha Motta,
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:20,064 [Speaker 14]
Bryce Cooper, Joe DeRosa.
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:25,244 [Speaker 15]
Hello, city council members, city staff,
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,844 [Speaker 15]
and community members. My name is Samantha
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,944 [Speaker 15]
Motta, and I'm a candidate running for
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:32,444 [Speaker 15]
the thirty-seventh Congressional District.
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:35,704 [Speaker 15]
I'm here to urge city council to amend AB
00:13:35,904 --> 00:13:38,384 [Speaker 15]
551 into the city's zoning ordinance to
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:40,384 [Speaker 15]
support policy development, community
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,644 [Speaker 15]
needs assessments, and then to improve
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,094 [Speaker 15]
local food systems and promote
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:46,534 [Speaker 15]
regenerative agricultural practices. It
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:47,804 [Speaker 15]
will aid in the reinforcement and
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,914 [Speaker 15]
strengthening of plans, policies, and
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,474 [Speaker 15]
programs set forth by Santa Monica. It is
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:53,744 [Speaker 15]
a response to the commercial and
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,464 [Speaker 15]
residential development that threatens to
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,644 [Speaker 15]
engulf millions of acres of state lands,
00:13:57,684 --> 00:13:59,224 [Speaker 15]
which will be consumed by urban
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:01,264 [Speaker 15]
development. In the past decade, there
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:02,794 [Speaker 15]
were more than forty-eight thousand four
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,824 [Speaker 15]
hundred and ninety eligible vacant lots
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:07,514 [Speaker 15]
across LA County's eighty-eight cities.
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,054 [Speaker 15]
Why not be one of them? Like many other
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,714 [Speaker 15]
municipalities, there is observed and
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,494 [Speaker 15]
recorded neglected land that remains
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,534 [Speaker 15]
blighted and squandered for years. As
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,424 [Speaker 15]
servants, it is our responsibilities to
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:19,494 [Speaker 15]
support policies and programs that improve
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,174 [Speaker 15]
our communities and neighborhoods.
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:22,824 [Speaker 15]
Instead, our communities are being sold
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:24,334 [Speaker 15]
out and privatized in the name of
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:26,594 [Speaker 15]
affordable housing. Vacant lots should be
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,884 [Speaker 15]
utilized for agricultural and animal
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,664 [Speaker 15]
husbandry purposes to address food
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,514 [Speaker 15]
apartheid, promote food equity, and
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,714 [Speaker 15]
accelerate Santa Monica to a, a more
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,784 [Speaker 15]
equitable, resilient, healthy, and
00:14:36,824 --> 00:14:39,164 [Speaker 15]
compassionate future. Equally important
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:40,964 [Speaker 15]
are the grants and funds provided to
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,304 [Speaker 15]
cities in California, who establish a
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,674 [Speaker 15]
comprehensive set of goals, policies, and
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,404 [Speaker 15]
objectives to support the long-term
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:49,684 [Speaker 15]
protection of agricultural lands and put
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,864 [Speaker 15]
them back into the hands of the community.
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:54,204 [Speaker 15]
This is only possible by converting urban
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,524 [Speaker 15]
land into conservable agrica-
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,784 [Speaker 15]
agricultural land. This isn't fear or
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,504 [Speaker 15]
NIMBYism, but a retort to densification
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,884 [Speaker 15]
and urbanism, all the while having a lack
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:06,644 [Speaker 15]
of regenerative and reliable food sources.
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,524 [Speaker 15]
In 2017, we used to say it's not
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:10,064 [Speaker 15]
affordable housing versus urban
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,764 [Speaker 15]
agriculture. Now, in 2026, at the rate and
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,064 [Speaker 15]
ineffectiveness of our so-called leaders,
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:17,153 [Speaker 15]
affordable housing means nothing without
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:19,704 [Speaker 15]
an affordable planet. Young activists like
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,404 [Speaker 15]
myself are frustrated with service-
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,404 [Speaker 14]
Claims you want climate resilient cities.
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,584 [Speaker 14]
Thank you. M- Mr. Cooper?
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:32,124 [Speaker 16]
Council, Mayor, Mr. Chi, um, thank you
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,684 [Speaker 16]
very much for your time this evening. I'm
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,414 [Speaker 16]
here to speak in support of the Santa
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,744 [Speaker 16]
Monica Airport. Um, I'm also here to
00:15:37,784 --> 00:15:39,404 [Speaker 16]
address the inequity of the Airport
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:41,764 [Speaker 16]
Commission in its current composition yet
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,764 [Speaker 16]
again. I brought this up last meeting,
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:45,304 [Speaker 16]
that the, uh, commission was
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:48,004 [Speaker 16]
basically the second most costly
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,684 [Speaker 16]
commission to taxpayers. We feel strongly
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,544 [Speaker 16]
this is due to the lack of professional
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,484 [Speaker 16]
aviation-related knowledge that it takes
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,124 [Speaker 16]
to advise you, the council, on very
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,704 [Speaker 16]
specific aviation-related matters. Much
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:01,024 [Speaker 16]
like running an airport and future, even
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,984 [Speaker 16]
potential closure, these matters really do
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,724 [Speaker 16]
need to be at least weighed in by
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,504 [Speaker 16]
professionals with that, uh, experience.
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:09,634 [Speaker 16]
It was also explained to Mr. Snell that
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,914 [Speaker 16]
this is essentially a low-cost committee
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,754 [Speaker 16]
based on the fact that it's paid out of
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,784 [Speaker 16]
the airport fund instead of the general
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,284 [Speaker 16]
fund. It's a very unique, uh, view on
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,304 [Speaker 16]
that, but this is the exact reason that
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:21,844 [Speaker 16]
we, as users of the airport and
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:24,174 [Speaker 16]
stakeholders, do need to be represented.
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,504 [Speaker 16]
This is even more a reason to be
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:27,804 [Speaker 16]
represented. Uh, all we ask is that you
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:29,804 [Speaker 16]
support an immediate addition to the
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,974 [Speaker 16]
commission of a person or persons with
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:34,124 [Speaker 16]
aviation-related knowledge in management
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,384 [Speaker 16]
or facilities management of that nature.
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:38,864 [Speaker 16]
In closing, there was also a recent
00:16:38,904 --> 00:16:40,873 [Speaker 16]
independent poll some of you may have seen
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:42,764 [Speaker 16]
in the Santa Monica Daily Press, that
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,964 [Speaker 16]
showed that sixty-three percent of
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,084 [Speaker 16]
citizens support the airport. Not closure,
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,394 [Speaker 16]
support the airport. Granted, polls can
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,093 [Speaker 16]
always be interpreted, but this was a
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,644 [Speaker 16]
rather independent poll. Please pay
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:56,804 [Speaker 16]
attention to those results. A lot can
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,624 [Speaker 16]
change in ten years. Just look what two
00:16:58,664 --> 00:17:00,364 [Speaker 16]
terms of change can bring in the mind of
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,404 [Speaker 16]
voters in our national government, let
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,824 [Speaker 16]
alone our city. Please pay attention to
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:06,604 [Speaker 16]
the voters instead of the echo chamber
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,084 [Speaker 16]
that has become the Airport Commission,
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:09,264 [Speaker 16]
comprised of persons that are
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,104 [Speaker 16]
unapologetically using their public
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,724 [Speaker 16]
position to project personal sentiment.
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,004 [Speaker 16]
This is what democracy is about. This is
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,504 [Speaker 16]
not meant to be an echo chamber of people
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:20,184 [Speaker 16]
who are anti-airport or pro-park. They're
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:22,164 [Speaker 16]
unapologetic about it, which is fine, but
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,474 [Speaker 16]
the reality is they should not be using
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,484 [Speaker 16]
their pulpit to influence those decisions,
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:26,754 [Speaker 16]
especially when related to you, the
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,594 [Speaker 16]
council members, that make these decisions
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,874 [Speaker 16]
on behalf of taxpayers. Taxpayers that
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:32,944 [Speaker 16]
paid-
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:36,044 [Speaker 14]
Thank you. Uh, Joe DeRosa.
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,054 [Speaker 13]
Thank you, city council members. Um, I
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:44,144 [Speaker 13]
have two simple requests. Um, there's a
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:45,844 [Speaker 13]
lot going on with the beaches as far as
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,884 [Speaker 13]
making it a national park and removal of
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,544 [Speaker 13]
the Coastal Commission. I was wondering if
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,523 [Speaker 13]
you guys could put up, like, an
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:52,744 [Speaker 13]
information site that shows the benefits
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:55,484 [Speaker 13]
and, like, the negatives, uh, for each of
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,624 [Speaker 13]
those actions for the public, so this way
00:17:57,664 --> 00:18:00,724 [Speaker 13]
they can develop an informed opinion. Uh,
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,384 [Speaker 13]
the other one was one I emailed you guys
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,884 [Speaker 13]
about today, about a parking regulation,
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,244 [Speaker 13]
uh, for parking transparency to prevent
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:09,444 [Speaker 13]
bait-and-switch parking. Like you see down
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:10,964 [Speaker 13]
at the Sears building down there, where
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:12,583 [Speaker 13]
they say ten dollars an hour, and then you
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,204 [Speaker 13]
park, and it's ten dollars for the first
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:15,544 [Speaker 13]
hour and twenty dollars for each
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:17,804 [Speaker 13]
additional hour. Since that's been going
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:19,784 [Speaker 13]
on over the last five years, we've solely
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:23,284 [Speaker 13]
see that area, um, become, uh, a black
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:25,684 [Speaker 13]
cloud come over it, and vacancies and less
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,344 [Speaker 13]
shopping, and it's right next to the
00:18:27,404 --> 00:18:28,944 [Speaker 13]
pier, it's right next to Santa Monica
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:31,034 [Speaker 13]
Place, and they're always out there with
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,924 [Speaker 13]
those ten dollar signs. And if you look at
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:34,604 [Speaker 13]
the reviews for that parking lot, they're
00:18:34,664 --> 00:18:35,744 [Speaker 13]
always getting screwed with
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,744 [Speaker 13]
seventy-dollar bills, and it puts a bad
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:38,224 [Speaker 13]
taste
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,404 [Speaker 13]
on local tourism, visitors, or anybody
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,294 [Speaker 13]
else who parks there who wants to come,
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:45,444 [Speaker 13]
and it creates a negative feeling for the
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,264 [Speaker 13]
downtown area. And I think it would be,
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,634 [Speaker 13]
uh, well within the city's, uh,
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:52,464 [Speaker 13]
standards to put an ordinance that-
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,362 [Speaker 5]
... prevents that type of stuff. Besides
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:56,052 [Speaker 5]
that, guys, thank you so much.
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:57,712 [Speaker 0]
Thank you. I appreciate it. We have two
00:18:57,752 --> 00:19:01,352 [Speaker 0]
phone callers. We have Anthony Jernigan.
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,332 [Speaker 0]
Ready for the phone callers.
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,692 [Speaker 17]
All right, Mr. Jernigan, you can press
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,112 [Speaker 17]
star six to unmute yourself, and your time
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:11,802 [Speaker 17]
will begin when you
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,292 [Speaker 17]
begin to speak.
00:19:16,412 --> 00:19:17,982 [Speaker 0]
Jernigan, you can go ahead.
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:17,982 [Speaker 17]
Hi.
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,652 [Speaker 0]
Go ahead. You can begin.
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,952 [Speaker 18]
Yes. Hello, can you hear me?
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,032 [Speaker 0]
Yes, we can hear you.
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:24,732 [Speaker 18]
Thank you.
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:28,612 [Speaker 18]
So, you know, in, uh, speaking to my
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:31,412 [Speaker 18]
fellow residents here, a lot of us are
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,272 [Speaker 18]
starting to feel like we're just
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:35,032 [Speaker 18]
completely being left out of the
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:38,232 [Speaker 18]
decision-making process in the city. You
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:40,632 [Speaker 18]
know, major policies move forward with
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:43,072 [Speaker 18]
minimal transparency, key discussions
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:43,612 [Speaker 18]
happen
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:47,412 [Speaker 18]
without clear explanation, and we're all
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,912 [Speaker 18]
left wondering, you know, does this
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:52,472 [Speaker 18]
council not know what's happening inside
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:55,242 [Speaker 18]
its own government? Or are you choosing
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,942 [Speaker 18]
not to tell us because you think we won't
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:00,182 [Speaker 18]
like what we hear? Because frankly, in
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:02,692 [Speaker 18]
many cases, residents probably wouldn't,
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,992 [Speaker 18]
but that's not a reason to withhold
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:08,512 [Speaker 18]
information. That's a reason to engage
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:12,652 [Speaker 18]
with us honestly and transparently.
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,912 [Speaker 18]
There's this growing perception that
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,152 [Speaker 18]
decisions are being shaped to satisfy the
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:20,172 [Speaker 18]
county, outside interest groups, or even
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:23,472 [Speaker 18]
political networks, rather than us, the
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:26,212 [Speaker 18]
people who actually live, work, and pay
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,152 [Speaker 18]
taxes here.
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,292 [Speaker 18]
Whether that perception is fair or not, it
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,052 [Speaker 18]
exists because transparency has been,
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,592 [Speaker 18]
let's face it, lacking.
00:20:35,612 --> 00:20:38,632 [Speaker 18]
This city is not thriving. Homelessness is
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,872 [Speaker 18]
worse than it has ever been. The
00:20:40,952 --> 00:20:43,012 [Speaker 18]
strategies implemented so far have not
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:45,122 [Speaker 18]
produced a visible improvement. Businesses
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:47,132 [Speaker 18]
are leaving. Commercial corridors have
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,192 [Speaker 18]
vacancies. Employers are questioning
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:53,252 [Speaker 18]
whether they can continue operating here.
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,592 [Speaker 18]
So what is the plan to stop that? What
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:58,912 [Speaker 18]
concrete actions are taking to stabilize
00:20:58,932 --> 00:20:59,952 [Speaker 18]
the local economy?
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,512 [Speaker 18]
And then there's the fiscal reality. We
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,452 [Speaker 18]
are hearing more and more about structural
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:07,092 [Speaker 18]
deficits and long-term financial strain.
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,182 [Speaker 18]
Many residents are concerned that this
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:12,212 [Speaker 18]
city is drifting toward the brink of
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,732 [Speaker 18]
bankruptcy. If that's not accurate, then
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,992 [Speaker 18]
clearly explain the numbers. If it is a
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:19,492 [Speaker 18]
risk, tell us what you are going to cut,
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:22,992 [Speaker 18]
reform, or prioritize to prevent it. The
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,612 [Speaker 18]
public deserves clarity. We deserve
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,492 [Speaker 18]
transparency. We des-
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,852 [Speaker 17]
That was two minutes.
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:36,052 [Speaker 0]
Okay, Mike Montgomery.
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:40,632 [Speaker 0]
Montgomery, are you there?
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:41,802 [Speaker 19]
Yes, I-- Um,
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:45,281 [Speaker 19]
thank you. Um, members of the council, I'm
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:48,732 [Speaker 19]
here tonight as a dad, um, raising my
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,552 [Speaker 19]
daughter in Santa Monica, and like every
00:21:51,632 --> 00:21:54,572 [Speaker 19]
parent, I'm constantly asking myself: Is
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:57,532 [Speaker 19]
this city getting better for her or worse?
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,692 [Speaker 19]
And right now, I mean, the, the kind
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,542 [Speaker 19]
answer is to say, I don't know, but, um,
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,072 [Speaker 19]
based upon what I've seen over the last
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,662 [Speaker 19]
number of months, I think we're headed
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:10,732 [Speaker 19]
down the wrong path. Um, you know, when,
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,172 [Speaker 19]
when we
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:15,892 [Speaker 19]
go downtown and see and smell people using
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:18,342 [Speaker 19]
drugs in the open, and, you know, and
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:20,281 [Speaker 19]
another small business we like is suddenly
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:25,272 [Speaker 19]
gone, um, when homelessness keeps growing
00:22:25,392 --> 00:22:25,781 [Speaker 19]
and,
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:27,952 [Speaker 19]
you know, we experience
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,592 [Speaker 19]
real-life threats, um, it doesn't feel
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:35,072 [Speaker 19]
like we see clear results. It feels like
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,512 [Speaker 19]
things are moving in the wrong direction
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,542 [Speaker 19]
and kind of, kind of like we're, we're
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,082 [Speaker 19]
stuck. Um,
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:43,221 [Speaker 19]
you know, what I think worries me most is,
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,362 [Speaker 19]
is, you know, all the problems, and all
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,492 [Speaker 19]
cities have problems. It's, it's... I
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,712 [Speaker 19]
think that I just don't understand the
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,172 [Speaker 19]
plan. I, I don't think most residents do,
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:52,332 [Speaker 19]
and
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,012 [Speaker 19]
big decisions get made, like the Ocean
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:57,392 [Speaker 19]
Avenue facilities, and families like mine
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:59,372 [Speaker 19]
are generally left trying to figure out
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,312 [Speaker 19]
after the fact what the actual strategy is
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,822 [Speaker 19]
and who the priority or the, who the
00:23:04,892 --> 00:23:07,372 [Speaker 19]
priorities are. The people who live here
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,632 [Speaker 19]
and pay taxes, or is it the outside
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,192 [Speaker 19]
pressure, whether it's, you know, the
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,861 [Speaker 19]
county, um,
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:15,792 [Speaker 19]
you know, the mayor's employer or advocacy
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,852 [Speaker 19]
groups like Jesse's employer or political
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,462 [Speaker 19]
relationships? Um, because from where a
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,212 [Speaker 19]
lot of us sit, it feels like our voices
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:27,432 [Speaker 19]
are an afterthought. Um, I think Santa
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:28,892 [Speaker 19]
Monica is an amazing place. That's why
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:31,152 [Speaker 19]
we're here. Uh, but a lot of parents are
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:32,682 [Speaker 19]
worried right now. We're worried about
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,392 [Speaker 19]
safety, we're worried about the economy,
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,492 [Speaker 19]
and whether we're getting straight answers
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,172 [Speaker 19]
from this council. So I'm just asking for
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:43,462 [Speaker 19]
clear priorities, real transparency, and,
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:45,552 [Speaker 19]
and leadership that puts the residents of
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,972 [Speaker 19]
this city first.
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,352 [Speaker 17]
And that was two minutes.
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:53,172 [Speaker 0]
Thank you. Uh, that concludes our public
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:56,292 [Speaker 0]
comment on, uh, non-agendized items. I, I
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,242 [Speaker 0]
also wanted to do a quick, uh-- a second
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,532 [Speaker 0]
point of agenda management. I would like
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,442 [Speaker 0]
to move the city manager's report up
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:04,182 [Speaker 0]
behind, uh, the special agenda items,
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:05,792 [Speaker 0]
'cause I think we have a special guest for
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:07,132 [Speaker 0]
the city manager's report.
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,452 [Speaker 5]
So moved.
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,012 [Speaker 5]
Second.
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,172 [Speaker 0]
Do we need, do we need a, a roll call vote
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:13,552 [Speaker 0]
on that?
00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:13,772 [Speaker 14]
No, you
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,032 [Speaker 14]
can just-
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:15,292 [Speaker 0]
Okay.
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:15,302 [Speaker 14]
You can just-
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:16,252 [Speaker 0]
Okay, all those in favor?
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:16,552 [Speaker 5]
Aye.
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:19,572 [Speaker 0]
Aye. Uh, any opposed? No. Okay, great,
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,332 [Speaker 0]
'cause I, I just wanna accommodate our,
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:24,692 [Speaker 0]
our furry friend back there. Um, okay. So
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:25,912 [Speaker 0]
we are gonna move on to the mayor's
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:28,832 [Speaker 0]
highlight, uh, for this month, and, uh, as
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:30,892 [Speaker 0]
we have been doing, we're honoring, uh,
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,762 [Speaker 0]
our city-- our amazing city staff, who has
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,992 [Speaker 0]
been helping to effectuate, uh, this
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,152 [Speaker 0]
realignment and, uh, rebirth of our city.
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:40,812 [Speaker 0]
Uh, and if we could call forward Grace,
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:43,732 [Speaker 0]
uh, Kitson, Sasha Sergeant, Claire
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:46,421 [Speaker 0]
Caldera, Rosie Cruz, Nia Engel, uh,
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,772 [Speaker 0]
Gilberto Sanchez, Laurel Byers. Don't be
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:53,172 [Speaker 0]
shy. Maybe they're not here. Um, Shelley
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:56,032 [Speaker 0]
Goings, Rebecca Ortiz, Merle Wynn,
00:24:56,092 --> 00:24:58,812 [Speaker 0]
Jennifer Yazzie, Richard Slagowski.
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:01,712 [Speaker 0]
Slagoski, sorry. Samantha Sinka, and Amy
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:04,392 [Speaker 0]
Lee. Um, I... You can, you-- if, if one of
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:05,552 [Speaker 0]
you wants to say something, that's great.
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:07,732 [Speaker 0]
I'm just gonna read off why we're
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:10,092 [Speaker 0]
recognizing you, and then we'll take a, a
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:11,852 [Speaker 0]
quick picture, and I just super appreciate
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,982 [Speaker 0]
everyone staying late here today and, and
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:16,532 [Speaker 0]
being here. So a, a strong... This is our
00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:18,162 [Speaker 0]
human resources department. We're
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,702 [Speaker 0]
honoring them today and, and our wonderful
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,092 [Speaker 0]
staff and the individuals who make it
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:24,382 [Speaker 0]
happen. Uh, a strong city depends on a
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,242 [Speaker 0]
healthy workforce, and hiring the right
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,482 [Speaker 0]
people and taking care of our city team is
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:31,082 [Speaker 0]
crucial to the success of the realignment
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:34,311 [Speaker 0]
plan.... and critical to the work is the
00:25:34,362 --> 00:25:36,802 [Speaker 0]
amazing team in human resources.
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,302 [Speaker 0]
During implementation of the realignment
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:42,302 [Speaker 0]
plan, HR staff has been continuously
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,822 [Speaker 0]
recruiting, testing, interviewing,
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:47,142 [Speaker 0]
onboarding new staff, working super hard,
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,562 [Speaker 0]
and the most recent new employee
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:50,721 [Speaker 0]
orientation class reached a record number
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,192 [Speaker 0]
of over seventy participants. That's
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,942 [Speaker 0]
amazing. This is a group effort consisting
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:57,672 [Speaker 0]
of staff from recruitment, benefits, and
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,472 [Speaker 0]
training, all working together to get
00:25:59,502 --> 00:26:01,882 [Speaker 0]
employees hired and onboarded to do the
00:26:01,922 --> 00:26:03,732 [Speaker 0]
critical work associated with realizing
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,372 [Speaker 0]
our city's goals. This effort clearly
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:08,492 [Speaker 0]
reflects our core values. The team's
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:10,652 [Speaker 0]
humility was evident in their
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:12,352 [Speaker 0]
collaborative approach and willingness to
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:14,642 [Speaker 0]
adapt, learn, and support one another
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:17,522 [Speaker 0]
under pressure. Their integrity showed in
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,762 [Speaker 0]
fair, transparent hiring practices and a
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:22,162 [Speaker 0]
focus on doing the work the right way,
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:25,302 [Speaker 0]
even when the timelines were demanding.
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:27,762 [Speaker 0]
The team's motivation drove them to meet
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,942 [Speaker 0]
ambitious goals while maintaining high
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:33,002 [Speaker 0]
standards, and their genuine care for the
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:35,152 [Speaker 0]
candidates and new employees ensured that
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:38,172 [Speaker 0]
each person felt valued, prepared, and
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:41,002 [Speaker 0]
welcomed into the organization. The HR
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:42,742 [Speaker 0]
hiring team's work during this period has
00:26:42,782 --> 00:26:45,572 [Speaker 0]
made a meaningful impact across every
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:47,772 [Speaker 0]
single department in the organization and
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:49,442 [Speaker 0]
set a strong foundation for future
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:53,232 [Speaker 0]
success. Your performance exemplifies
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:55,722 [Speaker 0]
excellence in service and commitment to
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:57,662 [Speaker 0]
our mission, and you all deserve
00:26:57,702 --> 00:26:59,632 [Speaker 0]
recognition for a job exceptionally well
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:01,962 [Speaker 0]
done. So I just-- I think it's appropriate
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:03,482 [Speaker 0]
if we all give a round of applause, and
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,462 [Speaker 0]
I'm gonna come forward with some
00:27:04,502 --> 00:27:06,942 [Speaker 0]
commendations.
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,562 [Speaker 0]
Okay, we'll do a-- Does anyone wanna say
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:14,642 [Speaker 0]
anything?
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:16,352 [Speaker 20]
I will.
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:17,222 [Speaker 0]
Oh, Dina.
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,482 [Speaker 20]
Thank you guys so much. Um, as you can
00:27:21,562 --> 00:27:24,402 [Speaker 20]
see, this is a really large number of HR
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:26,492 [Speaker 20]
staff here, and what that represents is
00:27:26,582 --> 00:27:29,112 [Speaker 20]
that it's not just one team. It-- There's
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:33,182 [Speaker 20]
so many pieces to hiring, recruiting, and
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:35,692 [Speaker 20]
hiring, examining, uh,
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,182 [Speaker 20]
onboarding. I mean, we've got people here
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:41,102 [Speaker 20]
who are, you know, on the HRIS team. I
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,202 [Speaker 20]
mean, there's so many pieces that go along
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,802 [Speaker 20]
with getting some of the butt in the
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,482 [Speaker 20]
seat, as they say. And so I can't tell you
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:51,262 [Speaker 20]
how proud I am of them and how, you know,
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:52,942 [Speaker 20]
they've, they've not complained at all.
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,262 [Speaker 20]
They've just banded together and done the
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:57,882 [Speaker 20]
work. So thank you so much for recognizing
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,162 [Speaker 20]
them today.
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:03,222 [Speaker 0]
Uh, you guys wanna take-- Are you gonna
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,082 [Speaker 0]
take some notes? No. Yeah, take them out.
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,002 [Speaker 0]
Oh. Take them out, 'cause I think we'll-
00:28:06,012 --> 00:28:07,122 [Speaker 0]
It's a nicer picture. Yeah, we'll go out
00:28:07,142 --> 00:28:08,942 [Speaker 0]

Come on over. Hi. Thank you.
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:12,682 [Speaker 21]
We'll take the-
00:28:12,702 --> 00:28:14,202 [Speaker 0]
If you can leave the yellow envelopes
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:14,502 [Speaker 0]
here-
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:14,752 [Speaker 21]
Oh, okay.
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:15,911 [Speaker 0]

00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:16,472 [Speaker 21]
Okay.
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:17,631 [Speaker 0]
Um, you can come up after. You guys
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,322 [Speaker 0]

00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,522 [Speaker 0]
Hi, hi. Yes, of course. Thank you.
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:26,922 [Speaker 0]

00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:33,512 [Speaker 0]
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hi, hi,
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:40,571 [Speaker 0]
hi.
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:55,482 [Speaker 21]
Madam
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,062 [Speaker 21]
Mayor, before we take the picture, can we
00:28:57,162 --> 00:29:00,142 [Speaker 21]
request that Sarah be part of the photo
00:29:00,202 --> 00:29:03,062 [Speaker 21]
also?
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:04,962 [Speaker 0]
One, two.
00:29:05,602 --> 00:29:18,712 [Speaker 20]

00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:28,382 [Speaker 0]
Okay.
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:33,802 [Speaker 0]
Now, we will-- I'm very excited to commend
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:35,962 [Speaker 0]
Santa Monica's first Black
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:38,902 [Speaker 0]
firefighter, um, if our fire department
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:42,582 [Speaker 0]
wants to come up, uh, and we're gonna do a
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:45,622 [Speaker 0]
commendation, uh, for Eddie Davis.
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,912 [Speaker 0]
We'll just give them a moment to walk on
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:53,792 [Speaker 0]

No, he's passed, but his, uh, widow is-
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:09,302 [Speaker 0]
Okay.

move to Women's History Month
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:16,962 [Speaker 0]
really quickly. Is that okay? But
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,062 [Speaker 0]
appreciate that everyone's ready. Um,
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:22,022 [Speaker 0]

00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:32,802 [Speaker 0]
Ms. Jacobson... T- city team, is Ms.
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:35,222 [Speaker 0]
Jacobson here?
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,172 [Speaker 0]
Okay, um, we will move on to Kidney
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:41,812 [Speaker 0]
Awareness Month. Is Dr. Rastogi, the
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,642 [Speaker 0]
Clinical Chief of Nephrology at UCLA
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:45,642 [Speaker 0]
Health and the Bruin Beans Health Club
00:30:45,662 --> 00:30:48,122 [Speaker 0]
here? I see lo-- We love our Bruins. Come
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,762 [Speaker 0]
on up. Um,
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,542 [Speaker 0]
so I'm gonna go ahead and read our Kidney
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,402 [Speaker 0]
Awareness Month proclamation, and then if
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,102 [Speaker 0]
you want to say a, a few brief words,
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:59,042 [Speaker 0]
then, and we'll take a photo. Uh, so March
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:01,242 [Speaker 0]
is nationalized, uh, recognized
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:03,922 [Speaker 0]
nationally as Kidney Awareness Month, a
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,622 [Speaker 0]
time dedicated to raising awareness about
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:07,212 [Speaker 0]
kidney health and the prevention of kidney
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,562 [Speaker 0]
disease, a serious and often silent
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:11,202 [Speaker 0]
public health issue affecting millions of
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:13,592 [Speaker 0]
Americans, and one in three adults in the
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:15,322 [Speaker 0]
United States is at risk of developing
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:17,402 [Speaker 0]
kidney disease. One in seven adults
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,922 [Speaker 0]
currently lives with the disease, and only
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,462 [Speaker 0]
one in ten individuals with kidney
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:22,362 [Speaker 0]
disease is aware they have it, due to the
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,462 [Speaker 0]
frequently in-- asymptomatic nature in its
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,952 [Speaker 0]
early stages. Risk factors for kidney
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:28,622 [Speaker 0]
disease include diabetes, high blood
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:30,692 [Speaker 0]
pressure, age, medications such as
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:33,092 [Speaker 0]
ibuprofen, family history, making
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:35,282 [Speaker 0]
education and early detection critical
00:31:35,402 --> 00:31:37,322 [Speaker 0]
tools in preventing progression and saving
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:39,782 [Speaker 0]
lives. And whereas early diagnosis
00:31:39,822 --> 00:31:41,642 [Speaker 0]
through simple blood and urine tests,
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:43,242 [Speaker 0]
combined with timely intervention and
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:45,502 [Speaker 0]
guideline-directed therapies, can
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:47,322 [Speaker 0]
significantly slow the progression of
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:48,742 [Speaker 0]
kidney disease and improve health
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:51,542 [Speaker 0]
outcomes. And whereas the Green Ribbon
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:53,682 [Speaker 0]
campaign, led in partnership with the
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,502 [Speaker 0]
Bruin Beans Health Club at the University
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,102 [Speaker 0]
of California, Los Angeles, my alma mater,
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,902 [Speaker 0]
and the Core Kidney Program, works to
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:02,542 [Speaker 0]
increase public awareness, promote
00:32:02,622 --> 00:32:04,262 [Speaker 0]
screening, and advocate for kidney health
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,762 [Speaker 0]
education within the Santa Monica
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:06,862 [Speaker 0]
communities. And
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:08,822 [Speaker 0]
whereas the City of Santa Monica
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:10,722 [Speaker 0]
recognizes the importance of supporting
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,622 [Speaker 0]
public health initiatives that empower
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:14,082 [Speaker 0]
residents with knowledge, encourage
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:15,872 [Speaker 0]
preventative care, and position our
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:18,142 [Speaker 0]
community as a leader in health advocacy.
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:20,312 [Speaker 0]
Um, so our whole council is declaring, uh,
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:22,492 [Speaker 0]
the month of March as, uh, Kidney
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:24,182 [Speaker 0]
Awareness Month, and we're asking all
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,522 [Speaker 0]
residents to-... seek appropriate
00:32:26,602 --> 00:32:28,342 [Speaker 0]
screening, support the Green Ribbon
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,622 [Speaker 0]
campaign, and joins- join us in raising
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:31,882 [Speaker 0]
awareness. And so if you wanted to give a
00:32:31,902 --> 00:32:33,572 [Speaker 0]
couple remarks, we'll then take a photo.
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:35,302 [Speaker 22]
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor, and,
00:32:35,382 --> 00:32:37,622 [Speaker 22]
uh, I'm a kidney specialist at UCLA
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:40,082 [Speaker 22]
Health, and I have this, my undergraduate
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:42,752 [Speaker 22]
club. So I just wanna point out that
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:44,322 [Speaker 22]
there's a connection between kidney health
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:46,882 [Speaker 22]
awareness and Santa Monica. We used to do
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:47,122 [Speaker 22]
the
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,402 [Speaker 22]
Kidney Fair at the Beach, um, at, at Santa
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:52,322 [Speaker 22]
Monica Beach, and, and the last one was
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:56,122 [Speaker 22]
2019, and, uh, it's been a big part of our
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,082 [Speaker 22]
campaign. And all that I ask is that a
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,262 [Speaker 22]
simple blood test and urine test can
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,642 [Speaker 22]
diagnose you. There are 100,000 people
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:06,182 [Speaker 22]
waiting on the kidney transplant list, so
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:08,502 [Speaker 22]
also organ donation awareness is something
00:33:08,522 --> 00:33:09,902 [Speaker 22]
that we really focus on. So I just want
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,762 [Speaker 22]
to thank everybody for having us over
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:12,532 [Speaker 22]
here. Thank you.
00:33:13,482 --> 00:33:14,252 [Speaker 22]
You wanna say something?
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:16,192 [Speaker 5]
You wanna say anything? You wanna say
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:16,192 [Speaker 5]
anything?
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:17,802 [Speaker 23]
Uh, just a couple quick words.
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:17,832 [Speaker 5]
Okay.
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:19,442 [Speaker 23]
Um, hi, everyone. My name is Simran
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:21,222 [Speaker 23]
Oblaker.
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:23,231 [Speaker 5]
Hi, everyone. My name is Rain Wong.
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,062 [Speaker 23]
And we are the co-presidents of the Bruin
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,792 [Speaker 23]
Beans Health Club over at UCLA. We work in
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,772 [Speaker 23]
partnership with the CORE Kidney Program,
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:31,292 [Speaker 23]
and we just wanna thank you for letting
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:33,442 [Speaker 23]
us come back here a second year in a row.
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:35,402 [Speaker 23]
We were here last year to proclaim March
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:37,202 [Speaker 23]
as Kidney Disease Awareness Month.
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:37,532 [Speaker 22]
Thank you.
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:38,442 [Speaker 23]
So thank you so much for bringing us back
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:39,062 [Speaker 23]
here.
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:39,712 [Speaker 22]
Thank you so much.
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:40,832 [Speaker 5]
Oh, of course. Let's take a photo.
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:42,942 [Speaker 24]
Um, oh, Mayor, may I share a quick story?
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:43,462 [Speaker 24]
I mean, well-
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:43,632 [Speaker 5]
Yes!
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:43,832 [Speaker 24]
Yeah.
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:44,362 [Speaker 5]
Go ahead.
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,722 [Speaker 24]
Um, so I shared this story last year as
00:33:46,782 --> 00:33:49,562 [Speaker 24]
well, but one of my friends, uh, her late
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:52,682 [Speaker 24]
husband had been diagnosed with, uh,
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,862 [Speaker 24]
kidney disease in the early 2000s, and
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,722 [Speaker 24]
when he was diagnosed, he was about ten
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:59,452 [Speaker 24]
minutes away from full renal failure. And
00:33:59,482 --> 00:34:01,362 [Speaker 24]
unfortunately, this is something that
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:03,422 [Speaker 24]
happens to a lot of folks who experience
00:34:03,462 --> 00:34:05,782 [Speaker 24]
kidney disease because the symptoms are
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,102 [Speaker 24]
very easy to mistake for something else.
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:08,422 [Speaker 24]
Um,
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:12,582 [Speaker 24]
she had actually ended up being able to
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:15,362 [Speaker 24]
become a kidney donor to her husband in
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:18,682 [Speaker 24]
2009, and he unfortunately did pass away
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:21,622 [Speaker 24]
in 2023, but that meant he was able to get
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:25,142 [Speaker 24]
an extra 14 years with her, with their
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:28,102 [Speaker 24]
pets, with his grandchildren, with their
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,542 [Speaker 24]
children. And so thank you so much for
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:33,382 [Speaker 24]
being here to share, to share awareness,
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:33,672 [Speaker 24]
and
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,802 [Speaker 24]
I, I really appreciate it. Thank you.
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:37,122 [Speaker 22]
Thank you.
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,622 [Speaker 5]
... Council member. Okay, we're gonna go
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,202 [Speaker 5]
in the row and take the photo, if you guys
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:41,042 [Speaker 5]
wouldn't mind.
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:41,552 [Speaker 24]
Amazing.
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:43,892 [Speaker 5]
In here. We can... Here, come on through.
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:48,002 [Speaker 5]
It's not a
00:34:48,082 --> 00:34:49,522 [Speaker 5]
competition.
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:51,751 [Speaker 24]
So I brought three pressures.
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:53,282 [Speaker 5]
Let's go all the way to
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:56,032 [Speaker 5]
the back. All of you are part of the club?
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:57,022 [Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:57,772 [Speaker 5]
Okay.
00:35:00,342 --> 00:35:01,302 [Speaker 24]
Tallest people towards-
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:02,911 [Speaker 5]
So much more professional than
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:11,032 [Speaker 5]

Okay. Um, I think we'll... Yay, I'm
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,762 [Speaker 0]
getting the thumbs up sign. We're gonna go
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:32,691 [Speaker 0]

00:35:33,602 --> 00:35:33,822 [Speaker 0]

00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:38,882 [Speaker 0]

firefighter, and I understand his family
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:42,922 [Speaker 0]

whereas Eddie Davis holds a lasting place
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:51,691 [Speaker 0]
in the history of Santa Monica as the
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,682 [Speaker 0]
city's first Black firefighter and a
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:56,582 [Speaker 0]
trailblazer who helped open doors in a
00:35:56,642 --> 00:35:58,502 [Speaker 0]
profession that has long excluded people
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:02,222 [Speaker 0]
of color, and whereas in 1965, during a
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:04,112 [Speaker 0]
period of deep racial tension and
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:06,342 [Speaker 0]
significant societal change, excuse me,
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,562 [Speaker 0]
social change across the nation, he joined
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,662 [Speaker 0]
the Santa Monica Fire Department at a
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:13,262 [Speaker 0]
time when integration required
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:16,292 [Speaker 0]
extraordinary courage, resilience, and
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:18,742 [Speaker 0]
quiet determination. And whereas serving
00:36:18,782 --> 00:36:21,382 [Speaker 0]
during the racially charged 1960s, Mr.
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:23,592 [Speaker 0]
Davis persevered through adversity and
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:25,722 [Speaker 0]
discrimination with professionalism and
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:28,662 [Speaker 0]
integrity, demonstrating unwavering
00:36:28,742 --> 00:36:30,762 [Speaker 0]
commitment to protecting the residents of
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:33,702 [Speaker 0]
Santa Monica. And whereas over the course
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:36,142 [Speaker 0]
of a long and dedicated career, he earned
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:37,762 [Speaker 0]
the respect of his colleagues and the
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:39,562 [Speaker 0]
community, becoming a well-liked
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:41,712 [Speaker 0]
firefighter known for his service,
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,022 [Speaker 0]
character, and leadership. And whereas the
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,962 [Speaker 0]
legacy of Eddie Davis is one not only of
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,882 [Speaker 0]
honorable public service, but of
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:51,342 [Speaker 0]
meaningful progress, reminding us that
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,882 [Speaker 0]
institutions evolve because individuals
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:56,062 [Speaker 0]
are willing to step forward, endure
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,182 [Speaker 0]
resistance, and remain committed to
00:36:58,242 --> 00:37:00,522 [Speaker 0]
excellence. Uh, and I would just say it's
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:02,082 [Speaker 0]
so fitting that we're honoring, uh, him
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,962 [Speaker 0]

00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:05,222 [Speaker 0]
important, so thank you all for being
00:37:05,242 --> 00:37:07,882 [Speaker 0]

00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:17,682 [Speaker 0]
within the fire service, and his lasting
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:20,322 [Speaker 0]
contributions to the City of Santa Monica.
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:21,512 [Speaker 0]
And I don't know if anyone wants to say a
00:37:21,602 --> 00:37:23,302 [Speaker 0]
few words while we come down and present
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:25,142 [Speaker 0]
the proclamation.
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:28,462 [Speaker 0]
Don't be shy!
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:31,902 [Speaker 0]
It's your time to shine.
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:35,022 [Speaker 25]
To my right is my mother, Annie H. Davis,
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:38,502 [Speaker 25]
firefighter Davis's wife. I am Red Davis,
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:41,162 [Speaker 25]
his, uh, baby boy.
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:44,082 [Speaker 25]
On behalf of our family,
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:47,422 [Speaker 25]
uh, there's four generations standing
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:48,842 [Speaker 25]
behind me, by the way.
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:54,132 [Speaker 25]
We thank you for this wonderful honor, and
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:55,882 [Speaker 25]
I'm gonna keep it brief. Thank you very
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:56,982 [Speaker 25]
much.
00:37:57,022 --> 00:37:57,552 [Speaker 0]
Thank you.
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,232 [Speaker 25]
You wanna say something, Ma?
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,402 [Speaker 22]
You know what? I'd just like
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,742 [Speaker 22]
to say that, um,
00:38:07,322 --> 00:38:10,122 [Speaker 22]
it was nice while he was there.
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:11,782 [Speaker 22]
We would have
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:13,622 [Speaker 22]
dinners that
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:16,382 [Speaker 22]
sometimes I would cook
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:18,202 [Speaker 22]
and take to them
00:38:20,442 --> 00:38:22,482 [Speaker 22]
while he was working.
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:26,402 [Speaker 22]
And I miss everybody because I have met
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:28,502 [Speaker 22]
some very nice young ladies
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:29,722 [Speaker 22]
there.
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:34,994 [Speaker 26]
... and we would go and have the wives'
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:35,854 [Speaker 26]
meetings,
00:38:37,474 --> 00:38:37,874 [Speaker 26]
and
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:42,814 [Speaker 26]
everything was always so nice because they
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:43,794 [Speaker 26]
would tell me
00:38:44,494 --> 00:38:44,714 [Speaker 26]
what
00:38:45,494 --> 00:38:47,054 [Speaker 26]
was happening. And
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:51,414 [Speaker 26]
I'm a registered nurse, so I wouldn't be
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:55,374 [Speaker 26]
free all the time, but they would keep me
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:58,574 [Speaker 26]
up on what was going on.
00:38:58,654 --> 00:39:04,914 [Speaker 26]
And my husband, he was something else.
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:10,954 [Speaker 26]
And I, I am so proud of him, and I'm so
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:13,154 [Speaker 26]
proud to know that
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,194 [Speaker 26]
someone else think he's
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,634 [Speaker 26]
worthy of giving a word
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,473 [Speaker 26]
of honor to,
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:29,494 [Speaker 26]
because he would do anything for anybody.
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:31,064 [Speaker 5]
Mm.
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:33,714 [Speaker 26]
That's just the type of man he was.
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:38,854 [Speaker 26]
But he was also a Christian man. So
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,834 [Speaker 26]
the way it goes.
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:47,894 [Speaker 0]
...
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,734 [Speaker 0]
Are we okay to go get-- Does she wanna
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:56,214 [Speaker 0]
get-- Are you okay to go there for a
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:57,614 [Speaker 0]
picture?
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:58,344 [Speaker 27]
Let's put her in the chair.
00:39:58,574 --> 00:39:59,114 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, of course.
00:39:59,134 --> 00:40:00,234 [Speaker 27]
Have a seat, Mom. We're gonna take a
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:01,594 [Speaker 27]

00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:04,914 [Speaker 27]
Excellent. Let me get it. Okay.

Okay. Um, can we have the family come

Severity.
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:35,414 [Speaker 27]
I recorded it, so I think we'll put it
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,034 [Speaker 27]

00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,894 [Speaker 5]

more interesting and exciting City
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,010 [Speaker 1]
Manager's update for everyone this
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,830 [Speaker 1]
evening. Um, before we get to the start of
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,810 [Speaker 1]
the City Manager's report this, um,
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,919 [Speaker 1]
tonight, um, a couple of quick things to
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880 [Speaker 1]
let the council and community know about.
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,680 [Speaker 1]
Um, first off, um, did anyone watch the
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,420 [Speaker 1]
NBA All-Star Game last week at Intuit,
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,760 [Speaker 1]
just up the street? Um, was a new format
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,760 [Speaker 1]
to the game. We saw some interesting
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,360 [Speaker 1]
things happen on the court. Um, what
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,720 [Speaker 1]
happened off the court was also super
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,660 [Speaker 1]
interesting. Did you know that the NBA
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,220 [Speaker 1]
designated Santa Monica as the location
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,290 [Speaker 1]
for all of the NBA All-Stars? Um, the
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,740 [Speaker 1]
Regent Hotel was identified as the
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,400 [Speaker 1]
location that all of the NBA All-Star
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,780 [Speaker 1]
players and NBA personnel stayed at. Santa
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,370 [Speaker 1]
Monica was their base of operation. Um,
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,400 [Speaker 1]
our team at the police department did a
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,320 [Speaker 1]
great job
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,440 [Speaker 1]
keeping things under wrap, while they also
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,960 [Speaker 1]
coordinated a bunch of security-related
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,700 [Speaker 1]
efforts with the NBA. Public works team
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,920 [Speaker 1]
did a great job keeping downtown looking
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,280 [Speaker 1]
terrific, um, with a special shine as we
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,680 [Speaker 1]
had this terrific event coordinated in the
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,360 [Speaker 1]
region. And really, with so many sporting
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,200 [Speaker 1]
events coming up the next couple of
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040 [Speaker 1]
years, um, it was really cool internally
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,800 [Speaker 1]
to know Santa Monica's still a place
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,759 [Speaker 1]
people want to be when there are big
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,220 [Speaker 1]
events in the region. We're looking
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,780 [Speaker 1]
forward to more to come as we move into
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,940 [Speaker 1]
the next couple of years. Um, a couple
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,680 [Speaker 1]

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,620 [Speaker 1]
as we introduce our adoptable pet
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,230 [Speaker 1]

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,880 [Speaker 1]
pets in person. I see Rob coming up with
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,580 [Speaker 1]
our team from the
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,080 [Speaker 1]
animal shelter, and today, instead of just
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,800 [Speaker 1]
a picture, we wanted to introduce
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,420 [Speaker 1]
everyone in person to
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,580 [Speaker 1]
Colonel, a two-and-a-half-year-old
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,220 [Speaker 1]
Shepherd Husky mix. He loves going for
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,810 [Speaker 1]
walks, playing catch or playing with
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,710 [Speaker 1]
stuffies in the yard, and exploring. Um,
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,420 [Speaker 1]
everyone, take a look. He is here in the
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,200 [Speaker 1]
council chambers. We hope the council will
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,900 [Speaker 1]
come and take a look. We hope somebody
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,680 [Speaker 1]
out there sees Colonel, decides that
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,740 [Speaker 1]
Colonel needs to be part of their family.
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,480 [Speaker 1]
Please contact the animal shelter if
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,680 [Speaker 1]
you're interested in meeting him, and as
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,620 [Speaker 1]

know about him from his owners that
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,740 [Speaker 3]
surrendered is that he, uh, very playful,
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,120 [Speaker 3]
likes to play with his toys, likes to go
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,720 [Speaker 3]
for walks, gets along with other dogs. Uh,
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,280 [Speaker 3]

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,640 [Speaker 4]
Thank you. Great.
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,140 [Speaker 0]
Who's, who's adopting him here?
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,230 [Speaker 4]
He's so sweet.
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,410 [Speaker 3]
We can do the paperwork tonight.
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,770 [Speaker 0]
Yeah.
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,930 [Speaker 4]
Thank you. Thank you.
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:14,900 [Speaker 0]
Come
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,920 [Speaker 0]
visit.
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,080 [Speaker 4]
I will. I will.
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,540 [Speaker 0]
Colonel's providing emotional support to
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,700 [Speaker 0]
everyone here today. Um, okay, amazing.
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,740 [Speaker 0]
We're now gonna move on to public input
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,420 [Speaker 0]
under, uh, consent calendar items, and we
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,200 [Speaker 0]
have, um, one, one, uh, Andrea, and then I
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,310 [Speaker 0]
think we do have one on the
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,860 [Speaker 0]
phone.
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,220 [Speaker 0]
Mary's keeping us clean there.
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360 [Speaker 1]
Thank you.
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,220 [Speaker 5]
Hello again. My name is Andrea McPherson.
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,380 [Speaker 5]
I spoke about my extenuating circumstances
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,620 [Speaker 5]
due to lack of proper care of the EMTs of
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,230 [Speaker 5]
Long Beach. Basically, EMTs need, uh,
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,540 [Speaker 5]
better communication equipment to receive
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800 [Speaker 5]
patients' private information to help save
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,180 [Speaker 5]
lives. I gave the secretary my ID
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,520 [Speaker 5]
bracelet that contains information about
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,140 [Speaker 5]
my chronic illness. It, uh, it is easily
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,760 [Speaker 5]
accessible and complete with a QR code,
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180 [Speaker 5]
and if it's scanned, all info
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,830 [Speaker 5]
automatically pulls up on the screen. Um,
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,400 [Speaker 5]
the most positive thing that has happened
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,880 [Speaker 5]
throughout that extenuating circumstance,
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,100 [Speaker 5]
uh, is throughout that whole, um,
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,414 [Speaker 5]
situation, I received an ANA blood-...
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:28,793 [Speaker 5]
test, and it diagnosed me with lupus. And,
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,934 [Speaker 5]
um, it explained why my kidneys, um, were
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:34,244 [Speaker 5]
bothering me, and that is why I support
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:36,104 [Speaker 5]
Kidney Awareness Month. That's very
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:38,664 [Speaker 5]
important. But now I know why I'm in so
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,904 [Speaker 5]
much pain, and dangerously low
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,164 [Speaker 5]
electrolytes as well. But please think
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:45,504 [Speaker 5]
about working with, uh, the proper medical
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,804 [Speaker 5]
professionals to make disabled people,
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,044 [Speaker 5]
seniors, and disabled children safer by
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,724 [Speaker 5]
even placing, um, the key chains on their
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:56,544 [Speaker 5]
backpacks. That's a great idea, guys.
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,464 [Speaker 5]
Think about it. And, um, I approve this
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,224 [Speaker 5]
motion, but please give the, um, EMTs
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:03,904 [Speaker 5]
updates on proper protocol having to do
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,604 [Speaker 5]
with major chronic illnesses like
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:08,824 [Speaker 5]
epilepsy. Placing people on their sides
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:10,504 [Speaker 5]
instead of on their backs, and just all
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,784 [Speaker 5]
kinds of just different things, updating,
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:16,724 [Speaker 5]
um, proper information for EMTs, new and
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,644 [Speaker 5]
old. Thank you so much.
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:19,644 [Speaker 2]
Thank you so much, um-
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:21,164 [Speaker 5]
And the bracelet, I gave it to the
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,244 [Speaker 5]
secretary. If you guys just wanna take a
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,944 [Speaker 5]
look at it really quickly, it, it's a ID
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:28,584 [Speaker 5]
bracelet with a QR code. And then, uh, I'm
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:29,964 [Speaker 5]
gonna get out of here as soon as you guys
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:30,784 [Speaker 5]
take a look at it.
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:30,914 [Speaker 2]
I would love to see it.
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,784 [Speaker 5]
I'll take it.
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:33,284 [Speaker 2]
That's our clerk. Um-
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:33,994 [Speaker 6]
Thank you.
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:37,374 [Speaker 2]
Thank you. We also have Denise, uh,
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,624 [Speaker 2]
Barton.
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:42,384 [Speaker 2]
Go ahead, Denise.
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:43,504 [Speaker 7]
Hello, can you hear me?
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:44,194 [Speaker 2]
Yes, we can hear you.
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:44,234 [Speaker 7]
Okay.
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:45,804 [Speaker 2]
Go ahead.
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,484 [Speaker 7]
Good evening. This is Denise Barton on
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:49,964 [Speaker 7]
item 4H. Would this be our city council
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,744 [Speaker 7]
and mayor trying to make DI hires look
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,594 [Speaker 7]
competent for their positions, was it when
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:58,284 [Speaker 7]
they can't properly execute their
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:01,214 [Speaker 7]
positions? I ask because haven't you had a
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:03,174 [Speaker 7]
program like this at the Santa Monica
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,344 [Speaker 7]
Airport? How's that going? And don't you
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,164 [Speaker 7]
think you need to better-- but you need
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:10,044 [Speaker 7]
better results before you expand it
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:13,894 [Speaker 7]
citywide? You know, the Los Angeles Grand
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:16,424 [Speaker 7]
Jury has previously found Santa Monica to
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:18,384 [Speaker 7]
be one of the most financially mismanaged
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:21,824 [Speaker 7]
cities, but this city council carries on
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:24,864 [Speaker 7]
that reputation. Oh, and is the Human
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:27,344 [Speaker 7]
Services Department still posting receipts
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:28,164 [Speaker 7]
of funds
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:30,284 [Speaker 7]
any quicker than one hundred to two
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:32,924 [Speaker 7]
hundred days after receipt? It all goes
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,064 [Speaker 7]
along with the city,
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:35,863 [Speaker 7]
the city wanting
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:40,014 [Speaker 7]
to make as m- the city, city staff wanting
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,804 [Speaker 7]
to make as much money as they can, doing
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:44,344 [Speaker 7]
as little as they can. Thank you.
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:48,124 [Speaker 2]
Thank you, Ms. Barton. Uh, we will now
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:51,864 [Speaker 2]
move on to, uh, the consent calendar. Uh,
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,564 [Speaker 2]
and I, I understand that item 4D has been
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,944 [Speaker 2]
pulled. Uh, and w- is anyone recusing
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,364 [Speaker 2]
themselves from anything under the consent
00:08:58,424 --> 00:08:58,984 [Speaker 2]
calendar?
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:02,704 [Speaker 2]
Okay, I see no recusals. Do I want to hear
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:04,364 [Speaker 2]
a motion for everything but 4D?
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:06,504 [Speaker 6]
So moved.
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:07,524 [Speaker 8]
Second.
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,624 [Speaker 2]
Great.
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,084 [Speaker 5]
I'm sorry, was that Council Member
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,904 [Speaker 5]
Negrete? Okay.
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,584 [Speaker 2]
And Zernatskaya second, yeah.
00:09:16,284 --> 00:09:18,624 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Zernatskaya?
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,284 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:20,344 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Snell?
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:21,124 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,664 [Speaker 5]
Mayor Pro Tem Schwilk?
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:23,364 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,624 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Raskin?
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,164 [Speaker 9]
Yes.
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,284 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Hall?
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:26,924 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:28,324 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Negrete?
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,164 [Speaker 6]
Yes.
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,624 [Speaker 5]
And Mayor Terroses.
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,984 [Speaker 2]
Yes. Okay, that carries. We will now hear
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,904 [Speaker 2]
4D, uh, and Council Member Zernatskaya, I
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,544 [Speaker 2]
believe you pulled that, so are you asking
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:39,623 [Speaker 2]
for a staff report?
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,504 [Speaker 6]
Uh, no, I, I don't need a staff report. I
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:44,724 [Speaker 6]
just wanted to ask, uh, Mr. Santiago a
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,164 [Speaker 6]
quick question or two about some of the
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:49,244 [Speaker 6]
restrictions of our investment policy,
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,574 [Speaker 6]
just so that the public can, um,
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,144 [Speaker 6]
understand what limitations we have as a
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:56,814 [Speaker 6]
government entity within, uh, how, you
00:09:56,844 --> 00:10:00,164 [Speaker 6]
know, on how we invest. Um, so I, I don't
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:00,264 [Speaker 6]
know-
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,444 [Speaker 10]
Good evening, Council and Mayor.
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,164 [Speaker 6]
Hi.
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:03,194 [Speaker 10]
Hi.
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:04,724 [Speaker 6]
Thank you so much for being here, Mr.
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:05,344 [Speaker 6]
Santiago.
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:05,804 [Speaker 10]
Sure.
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,444 [Speaker 6]
Uh, so I, I noticed that in our investment
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:12,644 [Speaker 6]
policy, it stated that we have, uh, we
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,884 [Speaker 6]
had a divestment of Russia-based
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,464 [Speaker 6]
investments due to the Russia-Ukraine war
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:20,324 [Speaker 6]
beginning in twenty twenty-two. Um, can
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:22,034 [Speaker 6]
you please confirm whether that's still
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:24,124 [Speaker 6]
the case, and if there is any state laws
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:25,704 [Speaker 6]
that also affect that?
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:27,764 [Speaker 10]
That is still the case. It was, um, a
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,204 [Speaker 10]
policy that council implemented in twenty
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:30,644 [Speaker 10]
twenty-two, so we're still observing that
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:33,534 [Speaker 10]
policy. And we, um, we divested some of
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,274 [Speaker 10]
our investments. The ones that we have are
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:38,084 [Speaker 10]
insurance, um, type of investments, so we
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:40,724 [Speaker 10]
can't really tie them to, um, Russia
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,444 [Speaker 10]
investments or anything like that, uh,
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,264 [Speaker 10]
specifically, but we have, um, you know,
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,744 [Speaker 10]
kind of d- divested from the other
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:46,464 [Speaker 10]
investments.
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:47,264 [Speaker 6]
Okay, thank you.
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:47,274 [Speaker 10]
Yeah.
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:50,224 [Speaker 6]
And, um, last year when we went over this,
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:52,754 [Speaker 6]
I believe we had added a probi-
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,564 [Speaker 6]
prohibition on cryptocurrency and
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,824 [Speaker 6]
crypto-related investments. Uh, but could
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,824 [Speaker 6]
you please confirm if there is now also
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:04,154 [Speaker 6]
California-level, um, code that prohibits
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,204 [Speaker 6]
municipal governments from investing in
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,664 [Speaker 6]
these types of investments?
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:09,054 [Speaker 10]
Yes. Uh, California Government Code
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:10,544 [Speaker 10]
prohibits it.
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:10,574 [Speaker 6]
Okay. Thank you.
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,004 [Speaker 10]
It prohibits, um, crypto-related
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,924 [Speaker 10]
investments and cryptocurrency.
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:13,954 [Speaker 6]
Okay. And-
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,974 [Speaker 10]
It's on page eight of our, um, policy as
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:16,364 [Speaker 10]
well.
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:19,444 [Speaker 6]
Perfect. Um, and... Sorry, go ahead.
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:19,714 [Speaker 10]
Yeah.
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,484 [Speaker 6]
Oh, uh, um, and last question. Uh, could
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,004 [Speaker 6]
you please clarify what
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:27,404 [Speaker 6]
w- what our investment policy means when
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:29,044 [Speaker 6]
it comes to socially responsible
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:30,344 [Speaker 6]
investing?
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:33,364 [Speaker 10]
So we, uh, prioritize investments that
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:36,184 [Speaker 10]
are, um, categorized as social, um,
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,164 [Speaker 10]
social, uh, government investing, I
00:11:39,204 --> 00:11:41,624 [Speaker 10]
believe. Um, and so we- they're
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:43,504 [Speaker 10]
categorized because they, the money that's
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:46,064 [Speaker 10]
used, the proceeds, are used for, um,
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:49,164 [Speaker 10]
for, uh, social causes. And so those
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,654 [Speaker 10]
investments are, are categorized, and
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,084 [Speaker 10]
they're also... Uh, there's ratings that
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,793 [Speaker 10]
categorize the investments. And so our
00:11:54,824 --> 00:11:57,104 [Speaker 10]
investment advisor, um, understands the
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,434 [Speaker 10]
policy, so when they, um, when they, um,
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,124 [Speaker 10]
recommend investments, they make sure that
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,344 [Speaker 10]
we kinda look at those investments first,
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:06,094 [Speaker 10]
and then we assess the, uh, returns with,
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:07,904 [Speaker 10]
uh, safety principle and all that stuff,
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:08,914 [Speaker 10]
when we're making decisions on our
00:12:08,964 --> 00:12:10,264 [Speaker 10]
investments. But that's one of the
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,504 [Speaker 10]
categories that we look at.
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,944 [Speaker 6]
Thank you. And, and the priorities, the
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,524 [Speaker 6]
priority in general for our investment
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:20,144 [Speaker 6]
portfolio is to preserve capital, um-
00:12:20,184 --> 00:12:21,024 [Speaker 10]
Safety, liquidity-
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:21,504 [Speaker 6]
Okay
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:23,544 [Speaker 10]
... first, and then re- a rate of return.
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:26,024 [Speaker 6]
Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Um, if
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,284 [Speaker 6]
nobody else has any other questions, I'm
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:29,704 [Speaker 6]
happy to move this item.
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:30,464 [Speaker 5]
I-
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,004 [Speaker 2]
Great.
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:35,004 [Speaker 11]
... I'll second it.
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:36,984 [Speaker 11]
Thank you.
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,744 [Speaker 8]
Thank you so much, Mr. Santiago.
00:12:39,804 --> 00:12:41,664 [Speaker 11]
Okay, Council Member Zarnestkyaya?
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:42,564 [Speaker 12]
Yes.
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,104 [Speaker 11]
Council Member Snell? Yes. Mayor Pro Tem
00:12:45,184 --> 00:12:46,524 [Speaker 11]
Zwick?
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:47,764 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:48,844 [Speaker 11]
Council Member Raskin?
00:12:48,904 --> 00:12:49,424 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,804 [Speaker 11]
Council Member Hall?
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:51,554 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:52,684 [Speaker 11]
Council Member Negrete?
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:53,304 [Speaker 13]
Yes.
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,344 [Speaker 11]
Mayor Terrosis?
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:56,424 [Speaker 2]
Yes. Fantastic.
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:00,864 [Speaker 2]
Um, we will now move on, uh, to public
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:04,114 [Speaker 2]
input on the remaining agenda items. Um,
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:04,604 [Speaker 2]
and oh-
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:07,284 [Speaker 11]
Before we do that, I'd like to ask if any
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:08,834 [Speaker 11]
council members have anything to report on
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:09,644 [Speaker 11]
travel-
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:09,984 [Speaker 2]
Thank you
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,504 [Speaker 11]
... since, since the last council meeting?
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:12,413 [Speaker 2]
Okay.
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,084 [Speaker 12]
Sorry. Um, this past weekend I was at the
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,424 [Speaker 12]
Independent Cities Association. I serve on
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,164 [Speaker 12]
the executive board. It was in Santa
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:24,224 [Speaker 12]
Barbara. Um, it was great, collaborated
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,924 [Speaker 12]
with other beach cities, inland cities.
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:30,464 [Speaker 12]
Um, sessions ranged from, um, how to
00:13:30,484 --> 00:13:31,913 [Speaker 12]
generate revenue in your cities without
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:35,844 [Speaker 12]
taxing residents, um, creating, um, tax
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,964 [Speaker 12]
increment financing districts,
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:40,984 [Speaker 12]
cybersecurity, um, tech, et cetera. But
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,854 [Speaker 12]
the biggest, um, takeaway was Coastal
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,594 [Speaker 12]
Commission. Not only speaking to the
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,364 [Speaker 12]
members there and the chair, but building
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,534 [Speaker 12]
those relationships, which has resulted
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,344 [Speaker 12]
in, um, Coastal Commission coming for a
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:53,604 [Speaker 12]
meeting here on Friday, and, um, more
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,684 [Speaker 12]
meetings with our city manager's office.
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:57,684 [Speaker 12]
So, um, yeah, that was Independent Cities
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,284 [Speaker 12]
Association, and, um, that was this past
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:03,224 [Speaker 12]
weekend in Santa Barbara.
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:06,534 [Speaker 2]
Great. Um, that sounds fantastic. Um,
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:08,904 [Speaker 2]
we're gonna move on now to public input on
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:12,574 [Speaker 2]
remaining agenda items. Jerry Rubin...
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:13,944 [Speaker 2]
With the exception of the public hearing
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,844 [Speaker 2]
item. Jerry Rubin, Luke Kane, Peter
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,784 [Speaker 2]
Whelan, Carol Valen, Connor
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:22,544 [Speaker 2]
Webb.
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:28,304 [Speaker 14]
Uh, before I begin, uh, I wanted to speak
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:30,324 [Speaker 14]
on the sixteen item. Is that-
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,224 [Speaker 2]
Yes, you may do that.
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:33,444 [Speaker 14]
That's the one now?
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:34,824 [Speaker 2]
Yep.
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:35,944 [Speaker 14]
Well,
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:40,224 [Speaker 14]
I must say I was, uh, very pleased to see
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:43,974 [Speaker 14]
this is on the agenda. I wanna thank, uh,
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,324 [Speaker 14]
Council Member Negrete and, uh, Mayor Pro
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:47,604 [Speaker 14]
Tem Zwick for
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,784 [Speaker 14]
doing this, because it's so timely
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:52,724 [Speaker 14]
and so positive that
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:55,944 [Speaker 14]
it's something everyone can get behind,
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:58,484 [Speaker 14]
and I think every business is going to
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:00,664 [Speaker 14]
appreciate it, especially the smaller
00:15:00,764 --> 00:15:03,664 [Speaker 14]
businesses and the dining people.
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,944 [Speaker 14]
You know, just as an aside, I hope this
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,894 [Speaker 14]
isn't too much off the subject, and
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,764 [Speaker 14]
everyone has a right to their own opinion,
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:15,283 [Speaker 14]
but when I heard these phone call public
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:17,424 [Speaker 14]
put downs of Santa Monica, I thought,
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,454 [Speaker 14]
"I'm not seeing that," and I go to the
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:24,964 [Speaker 14]
Promenade a lot. It doesn't smell bad,
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,104 [Speaker 14]
it's clean, it's wonderful, and
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:29,974 [Speaker 14]
all the challenges are gonna be overcome,
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:32,624 [Speaker 14]
and all the great events and everything.
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,194 [Speaker 14]
So I urge everyone to understand that, and
00:15:35,224 --> 00:15:37,004 [Speaker 14]
how everyone's working together to see
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,204 [Speaker 14]
that, and how everyone's understanding how
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,924 [Speaker 14]
important it is to get people out
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,144 [Speaker 14]
there. The weather is good, we wanna be
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,494 [Speaker 14]
out, we wanna be visible,
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:50,364 [Speaker 14]
and I just wanna thank you for doing this,
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:53,944 [Speaker 14]
and it's great to live in Santa Monica.
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,204 [Speaker 2]
Thank you, Jerry. Uh, Luke Kane, then
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,464 [Speaker 2]
Peter Whelan.
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,004 [Speaker 13]
Good evening, Mayor, good evening,
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,424 [Speaker 13]
Council. Um, you may have received an
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:12,244 [Speaker 13]
email from me, um, this week regarding the
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,153 [Speaker 13]
wastewater management fee and the waste,
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,504 [Speaker 13]
uh, the mitigation fees. Um, I work in
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:18,664 [Speaker 13]
leasing. I've been trying to lease the
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:20,584 [Speaker 13]
Promenade for six years. I'm deeply
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:23,424 [Speaker 13]
invested into this city. I grew up here,
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:26,624 [Speaker 13]
rent-controlled tenant. Um, you know, my
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:28,344 [Speaker 13]
family have the Britannia Pub. We've been
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,984 [Speaker 13]
in business nearly thirty years at this
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:30,324 [Speaker 13]
point
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:33,664 [Speaker 13]
and, um, you know, I've-- for the first
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,384 [Speaker 13]
time in a long time, it's felt like things
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,584 [Speaker 13]
are finally starting to come back. Um,
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,784 [Speaker 13]
you know, the weather's been great this
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,294 [Speaker 13]
year. We're off to... I, I honestly
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:43,653 [Speaker 13]
thought it was gonna happen last year, um,
00:16:43,804 --> 00:16:45,104 [Speaker 13]
but with the fires and everything slowed
00:16:45,144 --> 00:16:46,904 [Speaker 13]
us down. Um,
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:48,903 [Speaker 13]
you know, you guys have done a tremendous
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,944 [Speaker 13]
job kind of spearheading things like
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:52,584 [Speaker 13]
tearing down some of the red tape with,
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:54,764 [Speaker 13]
uh, you know, opening, you know, any type
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,364 [Speaker 13]
of business on the Promenade. But I just
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:59,544 [Speaker 13]
do wanna make note of, um, one of the
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,844 [Speaker 13]
issues that I'm running into, and it's the
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,464 [Speaker 13]
first time I've ever seen this, where a
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:04,864 [Speaker 13]
tenant is willing to take a retail space
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,884 [Speaker 13]
and convert it to a restaurant space. The
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,424 [Speaker 13]
level of investment with that is
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:12,144 [Speaker 13]
a lot these days. Um, we have these fees
00:17:12,184 --> 00:17:14,404 [Speaker 13]
in place like thirteen, like, like
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,044 [Speaker 13]
fourteen hundred dollars a seat, per new
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:18,764 [Speaker 13]
seat. Like, if you convert a retail space,
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:21,474 [Speaker 13]
say it's fifty seats, that's seventy Gs
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:23,074 [Speaker 13]
right off the bat, that you-- like, to get
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,854 [Speaker 13]
your permits, you have to pay that. Um, I
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:27,164 [Speaker 13]
think with all the work that you guys are
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,024 [Speaker 13]
doing, it's kinda almost all for naught
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:32,604 [Speaker 13]
if we don't waive those fees. Um, again,
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:32,984 [Speaker 13]
like,
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,284 [Speaker 13]
things are coming back, like, we can't
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,384 [Speaker 13]
afford a misstep, and I really believe
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:40,024 [Speaker 13]
that. Um, anything you guys can do to
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:41,904 [Speaker 13]
waive these fees would be a tremendous
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:43,884 [Speaker 13]
help to not only, like, the b- uh, real
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:46,244 [Speaker 13]
estate people like myself, but my family,
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,764 [Speaker 13]
all these other tenants on the street.
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:49,884 [Speaker 13]
Maybe they're thinking about expanding,
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,404 [Speaker 13]
maybe they're thinking about opening up a
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,244 [Speaker 13]
new location. You know, I just don't wanna
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,684 [Speaker 13]
impede on that. You guys have done a
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,464 [Speaker 13]
tremendous job, like, really spearheading
00:17:57,504 --> 00:17:59,144 [Speaker 13]
some of this stuff, so let's make it
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:01,804 [Speaker 13]
count. You know what I mean? So-
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:02,604 [Speaker 2]
Thank you-
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:02,714 [Speaker 13]
Thank you. Appreciate it
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,984 [Speaker 2]
... so much, and we did receive your
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:04,364 [Speaker 2]
email.
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:04,954 [Speaker 13]
Thank you.
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:05,224 [Speaker 2]
Um,
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,944 [Speaker 2]
Peter Whelan,
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:10,044 [Speaker 2]
Carol... Oh, yeah, great.
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,124 [Speaker 8]
How's it going? My name is Peter Whelan.
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:12,564 [Speaker 8]
I'm the facilities director for the LA
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,134 [Speaker 8]
Cargo Auto Group. I'm here on behalf of my
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,764 [Speaker 8]
boss, Mike Sullivan. We own twelve
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,844 [Speaker 8]
dealerships, seven of which are in the
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,764 [Speaker 8]
city of Santa Monica, and we employ
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,264 [Speaker 8]
roughly four hundred and fifty people
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,704 [Speaker 8]
here. In the last six or seven years,
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,124 [Speaker 8]
we've s- we've, we've put in excess of
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:29,684 [Speaker 8]
fifty million dollars into the
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,394 [Speaker 8]
restructuring of our facilities here in
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,914 [Speaker 8]
Santa Monica. Um-... in some talks with
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,664 [Speaker 8]
some of your s- staff, uh, transportation
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:42,624 [Speaker 8]
and, and, uh, code enforcement, w- I
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,694 [Speaker 8]
learned that we were doing this
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,764 [Speaker 8]
w- very late, that we were, that there was
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,904 [Speaker 8]
a safety study, uh, on Santa Monica
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,584 [Speaker 8]
Boulevard, and
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:54,004 [Speaker 8]
th- there, there, there's d- uh,
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:55,964 [Speaker 8]
uh, they're recommending removing the
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,044 [Speaker 8]
ability to turn left into our facility or
00:18:58,064 --> 00:18:58,984 [Speaker 8]
onto Park Drive.
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,364 [Speaker 8]
Uh, I feel that's sort of burdens on, on
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:04,754 [Speaker 8]
us. Um, there's some other things as well.
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:06,184 [Speaker 8]
That bike path's gonna remove some
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,564 [Speaker 8]
parking. I know you're doing work on
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,264 [Speaker 8]
Broadway, which we can't really talk about
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:11,084 [Speaker 8]
here, but that's gonna remove parking
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:14,304 [Speaker 8]
around our area. Uh, and while I'd be a
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:16,064 [Speaker 8]
fool to sit here and say I don't want
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:18,664 [Speaker 8]
safety, because that's what Item 11A is
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:22,784 [Speaker 8]
about, um, I, I do want, and I do,
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:23,454 [Speaker 8]
uh,
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:27,914 [Speaker 8]
I, I, I wanna support that item, but I
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,574 [Speaker 8]
wanna have a discussion about the ability
00:19:30,664 --> 00:19:32,884 [Speaker 8]
as to how it im- or the ability to, to
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:35,684 [Speaker 8]
access our facility. Um, and so I would
00:19:35,764 --> 00:19:36,634 [Speaker 8]
ask that you just
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,964 [Speaker 8]
y- y- approve the safety functions, but
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:42,504 [Speaker 8]
let's have a little chat about how we get
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:45,944 [Speaker 8]
in and out of our site. Okay? We've sent
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:47,604 [Speaker 8]
you a letter, uh, via email.
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,444 [Speaker 8]
Uh, I hope you get that, and take a minute
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:53,644 [Speaker 8]
to read that, um, uh, and
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:55,524 [Speaker 8]
see where we can go from here. But I'd
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,244 [Speaker 8]
really appreciate the ability to have a
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:59,424 [Speaker 8]
little conversation, uh, about that. I
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,664 [Speaker 8]
think that their response to that no left
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:06,284 [Speaker 8]
turn is an extraordinary, uh, action to
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,864 [Speaker 8]
take for a minimal
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:09,804 [Speaker 8]
issue. So
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:11,024 [Speaker 8]
thanks, guys.
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,044 [Speaker 2]
Thank you. We also got your email. Um,
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:16,444 [Speaker 2]
Carol?
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,684 [Speaker 15]
Good evening, Council. I'm Carol Blaine.
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:23,684 [Speaker 15]
I'm here to speak on Item 11A, shocker.
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:25,664 [Speaker 15]
Uh, first, I wanna thank all the staff for
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,164 [Speaker 15]
all the work they put into this project
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,384 [Speaker 15]
and many other projects. There are many
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:31,164 [Speaker 15]
components of this project that I strongly
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,434 [Speaker 15]
support, and I hope to see soon. One of
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:35,544 [Speaker 15]
them is the intersection at Chelsea. This
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,114 [Speaker 15]
will be such a major improvement for
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:39,314 [Speaker 15]
McKinley students and families. I would
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:41,234 [Speaker 15]
actually love to see it move to phase one,
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,313 [Speaker 15]
'cause I think this could have a much
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,153 [Speaker 15]
stronger impact than other improvements
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,124 [Speaker 15]
proposed in phase one, and I think we
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,624 [Speaker 15]
shouldn't wait that long to make it safer.
00:20:48,634 --> 00:20:50,184 [Speaker 15]
And while I appreciate other components
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:52,364 [Speaker 15]
of this project, such as curb extensions,
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:54,884 [Speaker 15]
far side bus stops, turner restric- turner
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:56,424 [Speaker 15]
restrictions, it's hard to believe that
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:57,704 [Speaker 15]
this is the best we can do with this
00:20:57,713 --> 00:21:00,244 [Speaker 15]
amount of time and resources. Staff has
00:21:00,264 --> 00:21:02,424 [Speaker 15]
done so much great work. It's not uncommon
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,284 [Speaker 15]
to hear people, um, talk about Santa
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,624 [Speaker 15]
Monica streets and say that they're much
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,404 [Speaker 15]
safer than other cities. One thing you
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:09,344 [Speaker 15]
don't hear is people think they feel safe
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,784 [Speaker 15]
on Wilshire Boulevard, and spending $11
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:14,514 [Speaker 15]
million to mostly duplicate what has
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:15,784 [Speaker 15]
already been done on Wilshire, where
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,944 [Speaker 15]
multiple people died last year, seems kind
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,104 [Speaker 15]
of counterproductive. So I don't mean to
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,354 [Speaker 15]
take away from all the work that has
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:23,344 [Speaker 15]
already been put into this, but when we
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,704 [Speaker 15]
continue to, to approve projects that kind
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,324 [Speaker 15]
of feel watered down from the community's
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,444 [Speaker 15]
perspective, it's kind of hard to believe
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,404 [Speaker 15]
that we truly take Vision Zero seriously,
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,314 [Speaker 15]
and take Vision Zero seriously, and want
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:36,104 [Speaker 15]
to, um, achieve it within our lifetime. So
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:37,544 [Speaker 15]
I'm not here to tell you what to do, but
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:38,854 [Speaker 15]
I hope you can at least have a meaningful
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,274 [Speaker 15]
discussion and follow through with your
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,924 [Speaker 15]
request from last meeting to prioritize
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,554 [Speaker 15]
safety over throughput and unfounded
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,304 [Speaker 15]
fears. Thank you.
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:50,284 [Speaker 2]
Thank you so much. Connor Webb?
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,614 [Speaker 16]
Good evening, Mayor and, uh, Council. My
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:54,854 [Speaker 16]
name is Connor Webb. I'm here to speak on
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:58,184 [Speaker 16]
11A. Um, I, uh, again, wanna just start by
00:21:58,304 --> 00:21:59,884 [Speaker 16]
saying thank you to all the milli- many
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:02,024 [Speaker 16]
talented people, um, that have spent
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,464 [Speaker 16]
considerable effort and, uh, done a really
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:05,844 [Speaker 16]
great job on many aspects of this
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:08,784 [Speaker 16]
project. Um, but two weeks ago, Council
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,504 [Speaker 16]
voted unanimously to acknowledge our
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:12,544 [Speaker 16]
failure on Vision Zero, which was our
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:14,064 [Speaker 16]
commitment to eliminate deaths and serious
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,604 [Speaker 16]
injuries on our roads by 2026. That
00:22:16,644 --> 00:22:17,964 [Speaker 16]
motion called for designs in the public
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:19,974 [Speaker 16]
right of way to prioritize human life over
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:23,704 [Speaker 16]
all else moving forward. And while the
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:24,614 [Speaker 16]
proposed plan has many good
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:27,304 [Speaker 16]
recommendations, I do not think it
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,294 [Speaker 16]
achieves the needed safety required to,
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,284 [Speaker 16]
uh, achieve that goal. And, uh, frankly,
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:32,624 [Speaker 16]
it seems very similar to the Wilshire
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,564 [Speaker 16]
changes, uh, which have been proven to be
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:36,384 [Speaker 16]
insufficient with multiple region, uh,
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:38,724 [Speaker 16]
recent tragic deaths. As a Mid-City
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:40,804 [Speaker 16]
resident myself, I've nearly been turned
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:42,784 [Speaker 16]
into a pink mist multiple times while
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,624 [Speaker 16]
using those new Wilshire crosswalks.
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:47,144 [Speaker 16]
Um, you know, now I walk an extra six
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,084 [Speaker 16]
minutes out of my way, um, just to, just
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,484 [Speaker 16]
to cross Wilshire, despite living right
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:52,144 [Speaker 16]
next to it. Uh,
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:54,933 [Speaker 16]
I want everyone on Council to, uh, think
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,724 [Speaker 16]
if they would allow their young children,
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,874 [Speaker 16]
or nieces, or nephews, or grandchildren,
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,664 [Speaker 16]
to cross those unsignalized intersections
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,754 [Speaker 16]
alone. 'Cause if the answer is no, I think
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:06,984 [Speaker 16]
we need to do better, seriously. And the
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,524 [Speaker 16]
best part of this plan is that signalized
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,314 [Speaker 16]
crossing at McKinley Elementary, uh, but
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:12,204 [Speaker 16]
it's a later phase item. Um, so please
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,264 [Speaker 16]
prioritize that signal and, uh, make it a
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:16,614 [Speaker 16]
separate near-term priority. Uh, but I
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,404 [Speaker 16]
think we do need to improve this project
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,554 [Speaker 16]
overall. Uh, whether that, you know,
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,624 [Speaker 16]
happens after approval, or we lay a clear
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,704 [Speaker 16]
path forward to getting those improvements
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,544 [Speaker 16]
done, I think changes do need to be made.
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:30,504 [Speaker 16]
Because this is a once in a lifetime, uh,
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:32,784 [Speaker 16]
opportunity to redesign one of our most
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:34,044 [Speaker 16]
dangerous roads in Santa Monica
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,224 [Speaker 16]
and achieve Vision Zero on it. So agreeing
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,304 [Speaker 16]
to a plan that is anything but
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:38,864 [Speaker 16]
exceptional
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,064 [Speaker 16]
is, unfortunately, just an agreement to
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:42,864 [Speaker 16]
fail on that Vision Zero commitment for
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:45,664 [Speaker 16]
decades to come. Thank you.
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,654 [Speaker 2]
Thank you. Um, I believe we also have
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:50,724 [Speaker 2]
some, um, virtual or phone callers, so
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,544 [Speaker 2]
Jacob-
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:51,674 [Speaker 11]
Yeah.
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:51,724 [Speaker 2]
Oh.
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,004 [Speaker 11]
Mayor, I'm sorry, we have one late
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:54,184 [Speaker 11]
speaker, Robbie,
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:56,084 [Speaker 11]
that just signed up.
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:57,664 [Speaker 2]
Great. Um-
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,844 [Speaker 17]
I'll, I'll move that to allow the speaker.
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:00,324 [Speaker 2]
Okay.
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:02,264 [Speaker 8]
Second.
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,914 [Speaker 2]
Do we need to vote on that? I... Is anyone
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:06,484 [Speaker 2]
opposed to that? Don't see any. Okay. Um,
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:09,764 [Speaker 2]
Robbie? Ms. Jones?
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:13,854 [Speaker 18]
I saw everybody here. Come down to the
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:14,624 [Speaker 18]
courtyard,
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:16,194 [Speaker 18]
red velvet cake.
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:18,944 [Speaker 2]
Wait, come and tell us about your-- tell
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:21,084 [Speaker 2]
us about your- Come over-- Come to the
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:23,504 [Speaker 2]
mic, Robbie. Come on.
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:24,444 [Speaker 18]
Okay.
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,504 [Speaker 2]
Tell us what you do, why you brought
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,124 [Speaker 2]
these.
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,344 [Speaker 2]
We're hungry. We haven't eaten dinner yet.
00:24:31,444 --> 00:24:33,584 [Speaker 18]
Oh, well, this is gonna drive you crazy.
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,744 [Speaker 18]
See?
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:37,084 [Speaker 2]
Oh, my God!
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:42,424 [Speaker 4]
... Oh, um, just Family Cafe Coffee Bar,
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:45,524 [Speaker 4]
uh, 1819 Pico Boulevard. I'm the
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,864 [Speaker 4]
owner, the first Black owner of a coffee
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:48,824 [Speaker 4]
bar on Pico.
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:49,294 [Speaker 11]
Mm.
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:51,914 [Speaker 4]
Historically African American property.
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,264 [Speaker 4]
Uh, but we got these wonderful desserts
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:58,864 [Speaker 4]
here. We came here to, um, be, uh,
00:24:58,904 --> 00:25:01,384 [Speaker 4]
present them at the reception for the
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:04,144 [Speaker 4]
first Black firefighter, and we have so
00:25:04,264 --> 00:25:07,824 [Speaker 4]
many left. And we brought a lot, 'cause
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:09,804 [Speaker 4]
that's what we do in the South, we make a
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:11,624 [Speaker 4]
lot of food.
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:11,653 [Speaker 11]
Okay.
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:14,664 [Speaker 4]
So we got peach cobbler,
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:19,044 [Speaker 4]
lemon pie, uh, sweet potato pie,
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:23,744 [Speaker 4]
red velvet cupcakes,
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:28,384 [Speaker 4]
and pecan pie, pecan cookies. We have
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:30,364 [Speaker 4]
everything. Y'all come down to the
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:33,504 [Speaker 4]
reception, and this will be in the office
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,504 [Speaker 4]
for you guys, or you want it right now?
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:37,384 [Speaker 11]
No, I'll take it now.
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:37,664 [Speaker 4]
Okay. But
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,464 [Speaker 4]
just wanna do a little infomercial. Thank
00:25:40,524 --> 00:25:40,764 [Speaker 4]
you.
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:41,124 [Speaker 19]
Robbie-
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,064 [Speaker 4]
No, we really just wanted you guys to
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:43,604 [Speaker 4]
taste-
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:43,994 [Speaker 19]
We'll, we'll take one, Robbie
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:45,704 [Speaker 4]
... what we have, and everybody come up.
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:47,144 [Speaker 19]
Happy Black History Month.
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:47,694 [Speaker 4]
Thank you.
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:51,384 [Speaker 19]
Um, okay, we have Jacob Wasserman.
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:56,984 [Speaker 11]
Mr. Wasserman, are you there?
00:25:59,264 --> 00:26:02,064 [Speaker 20]
Hi, um, this is Jacob Wasserman. I'm
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:03,984 [Speaker 20]
commenting on, uh, the Santa Monica
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,064 [Speaker 20]
Boulevard study. I realize the
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:08,104 [Speaker 20]
disadvantage of commenting remotely is
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:09,924 [Speaker 20]
that I do not get to have any of that
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:14,904 [Speaker 20]
food. Um, real shame there. Um, yeah, I'm
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,504 [Speaker 20]
a planning commissioner, but speaking for
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:17,614 [Speaker 20]
myself. Um,
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:21,544 [Speaker 20]
this study, it shows a lot of work, but it
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,754 [Speaker 20]
really, unfortunately, needs to be sent
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:25,974 [Speaker 20]
back to the drawing board. And I think
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,044 [Speaker 20]
particularly, the, the safety issues for
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:30,144 [Speaker 20]
pedestrians and bicyclists were raised by
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,804 [Speaker 20]
previous commenters. I wanna focus us on
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:34,904 [Speaker 20]
bus lanes. This corridor is a huge bus
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,844 [Speaker 20]
corridor. I take the one, um, all the
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:39,544 [Speaker 20]
time. There's metro on it as well. Um, we
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,244 [Speaker 20]
could put a bus lane that would speed up
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:43,684 [Speaker 20]
transit for not just all riders, but
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,744 [Speaker 20]
particularly our most transit-dependent
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,913 [Speaker 20]
riders, those, um, who can't afford a car.
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:51,664 [Speaker 20]
Um, but this report, it, it has, like,
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:54,584 [Speaker 20]
one partial peak-hour bus lane for a
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:56,753 [Speaker 20]
couple blocks, but nothing for the rest of
00:26:56,844 --> 00:26:58,984 [Speaker 20]
the corridor, where buses poke along in
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:02,144 [Speaker 20]
traffic. And I, I just wanna quote one
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,364 [Speaker 20]
part, it's about the
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,104 [Speaker 20]
downvote comments, upvote, downvote
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:08,164 [Speaker 20]
comment system that they had to gr- gather
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:10,064 [Speaker 20]
feedback. They said that the most
00:27:10,124 --> 00:27:13,104 [Speaker 20]
downvoted comment only had four downvotes,
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:14,304 [Speaker 20]
but then they said, quote, "It's
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:16,114 [Speaker 20]
reflective of disagreements in the
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:18,033 [Speaker 20]
community over the idea of reducing the
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,864 [Speaker 20]
number of drive lanes on Santa Monica
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:23,654 [Speaker 20]
Boulevard." Tell me, four downvotes, the
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:26,844 [Speaker 20]
most downvoted comment, is that reflective
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:29,544 [Speaker 20]
of disagreement? I don't think so. I
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,784 [Speaker 20]
think that we're just having a situation
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:34,384 [Speaker 20]
where some people say they don't want it,
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:37,284 [Speaker 20]
most people say they want bus lanes, but
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,244 [Speaker 20]
staff is treating
00:27:38,904 --> 00:27:41,704 [Speaker 20]
them equally. And I think that your vote,
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,464 [Speaker 20]
when you said that you were gonna commit
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:45,904 [Speaker 20]
to Vision Zero, commit to prioritizing
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:48,544 [Speaker 20]
transit riders and the lives, the lives
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:48,964 [Speaker 20]
and
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:52,224 [Speaker 20]
safety of our pedestrians and bicyclists,
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:54,084 [Speaker 20]
mandates that this study be sent back to
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:55,384 [Speaker 20]
the drawing board. There's no funding
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,564 [Speaker 20]
deadline here. There's no grant. You don't
00:27:57,624 --> 00:27:59,664 [Speaker 20]
have to approve this tonight. Um,
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,184 [Speaker 20]
unfortunately, a absent
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:04,524 [Speaker 20]
full bus lanes or at least something-
00:28:06,324 --> 00:28:06,934 [Speaker 11]
Thank you, Mr. Wasserman.
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:08,564 [Speaker 20]
That was two minutes?
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:10,584 [Speaker 11]
Ms. Barton?
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,584 [Speaker 11]
Denise, are you there?
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:16,764 [Speaker 7]
Can you hear me?
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,424 [Speaker 11]
Yes, go ahead. You can begin.
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:21,464 [Speaker 7]
Good evening, this is Denise Barton on
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:24,904 [Speaker 7]
item 16A. I'm baffled as to why you think
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:26,584 [Speaker 7]
the resident taxpayers should be
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:28,904 [Speaker 7]
responsible for any business upgrades on
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:31,604 [Speaker 7]
the Promenade, especially when you refuse
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:34,804 [Speaker 7]
to provide a safe city to the residents or
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:37,984 [Speaker 7]
to anyone, for that matter. Uh, and isn't
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:41,364 [Speaker 7]
the water and wastewater upgrade fees for
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:44,524 [Speaker 7]
outdoor dining, county fees, which
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:46,544 [Speaker 7]
require initial investment of tens of
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,244 [Speaker 7]
thousands of dollars? And aren't, and
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,313 [Speaker 7]
isn't, and aren't the Promenade businesses
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,544 [Speaker 7]
privately owned? Then why should the
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:55,714 [Speaker 7]
resident taxpayers be responsible for
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:56,434 [Speaker 7]
upgrades
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,244 [Speaker 7]
or conversions from retail to restaurant
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,044 [Speaker 7]
for privately owned businesses,
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:06,184 [Speaker 7]
that this, that this resident... th- that
00:29:06,224 --> 00:29:08,304 [Speaker 7]
the resident taxpayers will get no direct
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:11,704 [Speaker 7]
financial r- recovery from? This item
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:14,044 [Speaker 7]
looks like nothing more than further
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:16,044 [Speaker 7]
financial mismanagement from the city
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,804 [Speaker 7]
council members, Zwick and Negrete. Thank
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:19,994 [Speaker 7]
you.
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:23,704 [Speaker 19]
Okay, that concludes the comments on these
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,344 [Speaker 19]
items, and we will now hear the staff
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:26,994 [Speaker 19]
report on, uh, item 11A.
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:28,684 [Speaker 11]
Let me read the title first.
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,884 [Speaker 19]
Oh, my apologies. Sorry.
00:29:30,924 --> 00:29:33,044 [Speaker 11]
So 11A is receive and adopt the Santa
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,754 [Speaker 11]
Monica Boulevard Safety Study, funded by
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:37,673 [Speaker 11]
Caltrans Sustainable Transportation
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:41,884 [Speaker 11]
Planning Grant.
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:54,984 [Speaker 17]
Good
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:55,824 [Speaker 17]
evening, uh,
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,364 [Speaker 17]
Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, and members of the
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:01,144 [Speaker 17]
City Council. Um, my name is Carlos
00:30:01,164 --> 00:30:03,604 [Speaker 17]
Hernandez. I'm a senior transportation
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:06,154 [Speaker 17]
planner with the Mobility Division, and
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,314 [Speaker 17]
I'm very excited to be at this point,
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,744 [Speaker 17]
presenting the Santa Monica Boulevard
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:12,504 [Speaker 17]
Safety Study for adoption. I'm joined here
00:30:12,564 --> 00:30:14,004 [Speaker 17]
tonight by our partners in the Public
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,224 [Speaker 17]
Works Department, as well as Big Blue Bus,
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,944 [Speaker 17]
um, and they've been essential in shaping
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:21,624 [Speaker 17]
this plan. We last met in June, where I
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:23,574 [Speaker 17]
provided much of the background of this
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:25,604 [Speaker 17]
project and some of the work we've done to
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:27,724 [Speaker 17]
date. Uh, tonight, I wanna provide more
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:28,704 [Speaker 17]
of an update
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,544 [Speaker 17]
on the work since then, as well as our
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:34,864 [Speaker 17]
next steps for getting this project built.
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:39,608 [Speaker 17]
Oh, perfect, thank you.... So as we all
00:30:39,648 --> 00:30:41,608 [Speaker 17]
know, this project is a safety study of
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,288 [Speaker 17]
the entire two point four-mile stretch of
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:45,868 [Speaker 17]
Santa Monica Boulevard within the city
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,528 [Speaker 17]
limits. Uh, we know Santa Monica Boulevard
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:50,628 [Speaker 17]
is a key east-west corridor for our
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,888 [Speaker 17]
residents and visitors, so balancing the
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,078 [Speaker 17]
needs of all users is very important for
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,188 [Speaker 17]
this project. Through this project, we
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:59,678 [Speaker 17]
gathered existing conditions and t- a
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:02,958 [Speaker 17]
ten-year crash, uh, history, so we can
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,788 [Speaker 17]
really understand how the corridors
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:08,328 [Speaker 17]
function. Um, we did a robust community
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:10,808 [Speaker 17]
engagement process, where we've worked
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,238 [Speaker 17]
with stakeholders in the community. We've
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,508 [Speaker 17]
done, uh, mailed flyers, we've done pop-up
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:17,898 [Speaker 17]
events to really get as much feedback for
00:31:17,928 --> 00:31:21,108 [Speaker 17]
this project as possible, and ultimately
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:23,968 [Speaker 17]
identify targeted safety improvements for
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:26,238 [Speaker 17]
just about every intersection on this
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:30,368 [Speaker 17]
corridor. So I mentioned we looked at ten
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:33,098 [Speaker 17]
years of, uh, crash data as part of our
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,668 [Speaker 17]
safety analysis, and I just want to give
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,148 [Speaker 17]
you a very high-level summary of the
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,608 [Speaker 17]
findings, 'cause I know you've heard some
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:40,108 [Speaker 17]
of this information before. Uh, we
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:41,508 [Speaker 17]
essentially found that right-of-way
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,208 [Speaker 17]
violations are the primary cause of
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:45,338 [Speaker 17]
crashes, so one party crashing into
00:31:45,348 --> 00:31:47,948 [Speaker 17]
another party. For crashes just involving
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:50,388 [Speaker 17]
vehicles, the most common crash scenario
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:53,928 [Speaker 17]
involves broadside crashes. For, uh, in
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:56,908 [Speaker 17]
pedestrians, this involves drivers turning
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:59,378 [Speaker 17]
left into a pedestrian crossing at an
00:31:59,448 --> 00:32:01,708 [Speaker 17]
intersection. Through this safety
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:04,387 [Speaker 17]
analysis, we found that crashes occur
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:06,648 [Speaker 17]
most, most frequently at signalized
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:09,108 [Speaker 17]
intersections, but severity is higher at
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,848 [Speaker 17]
unsignalized intersections, so those
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:13,128 [Speaker 17]
locations where you have those stop signs
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,528 [Speaker 17]
on the side streets.
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:19,908 [Speaker 17]
So while the safety analysis provided a
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:22,808 [Speaker 17]
historic view of crashes, we wanted to
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,218 [Speaker 17]
talk to the community, get as much
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:26,418 [Speaker 17]
feedback, uh, as possible, and that's been
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:28,468 [Speaker 17]
essential for understanding their
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:31,148 [Speaker 17]
experiences along Santa Monica Boulevard.
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:33,068 [Speaker 17]
So engagement for this project kicked off
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:35,728 [Speaker 17]
at the Downtown Library, if you remember.
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:37,698 [Speaker 17]
It was a Halloween night, and participants
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,588 [Speaker 17]
were able to, uh, vote for their
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:41,268 [Speaker 17]
priorities and their vision for Santa
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,788 [Speaker 17]
Monica Boulevard on these really fun,
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:45,388 [Speaker 17]
interactive beacons. As part of our
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,697 [Speaker 17]
roadshow as staff, we actually visited,
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:49,607 [Speaker 17]
uh, Douglas Park, McKinley Elementary
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:50,968 [Speaker 17]
School, and the Farmers Market with some
00:32:51,008 --> 00:32:53,048 [Speaker 17]
project boards, again, to get the word out
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,528 [Speaker 17]
of the project and meet people where
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:55,017 [Speaker 17]
they're at.
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:57,968 [Speaker 17]
We've mailed over ten thousand postcards
00:32:58,048 --> 00:33:01,008 [Speaker 17]
to residents and businesses within a half
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,348 [Speaker 17]
mile of the corridor. We conducted an
00:33:04,428 --> 00:33:06,888 [Speaker 17]
in-person safety audit of key
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,808 [Speaker 17]
intersections and worked with, uh,
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,608 [Speaker 17]
Providence St. John's Health Center. Um,
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:13,268 [Speaker 17]
we've been working in partnership with
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:15,017 [Speaker 17]
McKinley Elementary School and presenting
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:17,457 [Speaker 17]
at their, uh, events and talking to the
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:20,748 [Speaker 17]
PTA. And we also hosted an online
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:22,628 [Speaker 17]
interactive mapping tool, where we got
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,188 [Speaker 17]
over three hundred and fifty comments,
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:26,688 [Speaker 17]
very detailed comments, that helped us w-
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:27,948 [Speaker 17]
uh, with shaping the design
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:32,188 [Speaker 17]
recommendations. Um, I will just mention,
00:33:32,248 --> 00:33:33,948 [Speaker 17]
we've also presented to our neighborhood
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,008 [Speaker 17]
associations, as well as the City Planning
00:33:36,068 --> 00:33:38,708 [Speaker 17]
Commission back in May. And the final
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,808 [Speaker 17]
engagement event, it was a big production,
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,498 [Speaker 17]
that took place at the Santa Monica YMCA,
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:44,948 [Speaker 17]
where, if you remember, it was an open
00:33:45,008 --> 00:33:48,048 [Speaker 17]
house-style meeting, and it was Route 66
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:50,498 [Speaker 17]
theme, so it was really fun and had this
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,628 [Speaker 17]
sort of Googie architecture style to it.
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:56,457 [Speaker 17]
We had, uh, sixty-two participants there
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:59,428 [Speaker 17]
take-- essentially take a road trip down
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:01,108 [Speaker 17]
Santa Monica Boulevard, and they were able
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:02,688 [Speaker 17]
to leave us comments on the fifteen
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,668 [Speaker 17]
intersections we had propped up on
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:07,848 [Speaker 17]
displays. So over the sc- over the course
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:09,668 [Speaker 17]
of this year-long engagement process, we
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:11,798 [Speaker 17]
learned that residents are mostly
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:13,698 [Speaker 17]
concerned with two things. One is
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:16,237 [Speaker 17]
pedestrian crossing conditions, and two is
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,968 [Speaker 17]
drivers speeding along the corridor. Of
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:20,508 [Speaker 17]
course, w- as I mentioned, we got a lot of
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:22,268 [Speaker 17]
detailed informati- information
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:23,708 [Speaker 17]
throughout the year, and that really
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,068 [Speaker 17]
helped us with the designs for each
00:34:25,128 --> 00:34:26,048 [Speaker 17]
intersection.
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:30,588 [Speaker 17]
Of course, we've also paired community
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,248 [Speaker 17]
concerns with the safety analysis work
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:35,848 [Speaker 17]
that I had mentioned, um, as well as our
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,168 [Speaker 17]
field observations and our understanding
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,248 [Speaker 17]
of land use patterns, uh, along the
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:42,908 [Speaker 17]
project area. So considering this, we've
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:45,388 [Speaker 17]
organized improvements into three buckets.
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:48,008 [Speaker 17]
The first is corridor-wide improvements,
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,148 [Speaker 17]
focus intersections, and transit
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,948 [Speaker 17]
improvements, and I'll talk a little bit
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,128 [Speaker 17]
about them. So we'll start with
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:55,487 [Speaker 17]
corridor-wide improvements. I know this
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,068 [Speaker 17]
graphic is a lot, right? There's a lot of
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:59,638 [Speaker 17]
information here. But the main takeaway
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:01,078 [Speaker 17]
here is that we are recommending
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:02,638 [Speaker 17]
improvements at just about every
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,748 [Speaker 17]
intersection on Santa Monica Boulevard.
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,888 [Speaker 17]
These corridor-wide improvements are low
00:35:08,008 --> 00:35:10,568 [Speaker 17]
to moderate cost, and they're applied
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,398 [Speaker 17]
consistently throughout the corridor with
00:35:12,448 --> 00:35:14,728 [Speaker 17]
an emphasis of, uh, addressing crash
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:15,288 [Speaker 17]
patterns.
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,048 [Speaker 17]
The types of improvements you see here
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,468 [Speaker 17]
include ensuring that pavement markings
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:23,208 [Speaker 17]
and signs are consistent, applying the
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,488 [Speaker 17]
right-turn only restrictions from the side
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:26,877 [Speaker 17]
streets at those signalized
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:27,648 [Speaker 17]
intersections,
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,568 [Speaker 17]
improving bicycle crossings through the
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,808 [Speaker 17]
intersections to get bicyclists onto the
00:35:32,828 --> 00:35:33,708 [Speaker 17]
bike network,
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:36,848 [Speaker 17]
installing leading pedestrian intervals to
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:38,908 [Speaker 17]
give pedestrians a head start at
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:41,328 [Speaker 17]
signalized intersections, and signal
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:43,938 [Speaker 17]
timing coordinations along all signalized,
00:35:44,048 --> 00:35:45,788 [Speaker 17]
uh, locations.
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,448 [Speaker 17]
For transit improvements, we're
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:51,468 [Speaker 17]
recommending relocating bus stops to the
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:53,308 [Speaker 17]
far side of the intersection to improve
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:55,608 [Speaker 17]
visibility, but also minimize
00:35:55,728 --> 00:35:59,078 [Speaker 17]
right-turning conflicts. So places with,
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:01,248 [Speaker 17]
uh, bus stop relocations include Sixth
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:03,408 [Speaker 17]
Street, Eleventh, Fourteenth, and Berkeley
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,138 [Speaker 17]
Street. And at Berkeley Street, that
00:36:05,148 --> 00:36:07,528 [Speaker 17]
westbound bus stop has already been moved
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:10,488 [Speaker 17]
to the far side in coordination with BBB,
00:36:10,528 --> 00:36:13,558 [Speaker 17]
and that was, um, us just already getting
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:14,958 [Speaker 17]
some of this work done in coordination
00:36:14,988 --> 00:36:15,268 [Speaker 17]
with them.
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:18,188 [Speaker 17]
So for locations where we can't move the
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:20,588 [Speaker 17]
bus stop to the far side for, let's say, a
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:23,188 [Speaker 17]
driveway or another conflict, uh, we
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:25,248 [Speaker 17]
propose queue jumps. This essentially
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:27,748 [Speaker 17]
gives buses signal priority at the near
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,188 [Speaker 17]
side stop, um, and lets them cut in front
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:33,788 [Speaker 17]
of traffic, as you can see in the graphic.
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:35,588 [Speaker 17]
These locations include Lincoln Boulevard
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:37,958 [Speaker 17]
and Twenty-Sixth Street, and at these
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:40,008 [Speaker 17]
locations, we also propose widening the
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:43,188 [Speaker 17]
bus stop or the sidewalk area, um, so we
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:45,088 [Speaker 17]
can have increased sidewalk space. The
00:36:45,108 --> 00:36:47,788 [Speaker 17]
buses will stop in lane, and that can
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:50,458 [Speaker 17]
prevent drivers, again, from sort of going
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,928 [Speaker 17]
around buses and making those right
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:54,058 [Speaker 17]
turns, causing some of those visibili-
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:57,168 [Speaker 17]
visibility issues.... The third transit
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,548 [Speaker 17]
improvement is peak hour bus-only lanes,
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,168 [Speaker 17]
specifically from Harvard Street to
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:03,328 [Speaker 17]
Centinela Avenue, where the road's wide
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,428 [Speaker 17]
enough to accommodate all the same travel
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:05,808 [Speaker 17]
lanes,
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,118 [Speaker 17]
um, and also new bus-only lanes with
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,588 [Speaker 17]
minimal impact, so they would operate
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,618 [Speaker 17]
during the peak hours. As you can see in
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,928 [Speaker 17]
the diagram, uh, the proposed bus-only
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,568 [Speaker 17]
lanes are recommended where there's
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:20,568 [Speaker 17]
currently a parking lane and only operate
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,048 [Speaker 17]
in the AM and the PM peak hours. So these
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:25,538 [Speaker 17]
are the times, um, bus service experiences
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:28,908 [Speaker 17]
delays. This design's similar to what we
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:31,748 [Speaker 17]
see out there on Lincoln Boulevard today.
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:36,088 [Speaker 17]
So our recommendation for bus-only lanes
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:37,728 [Speaker 17]
also support regional efforts that are
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:39,668 [Speaker 17]
being led by Caltrans and the Westside
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:42,608 [Speaker 17]
Cities Council of Governments. Caltrans is
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,628 [Speaker 17]
working on a peak hour, a bus-only lane
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:47,598 [Speaker 17]
project from Santa Monica Boulevard or on,
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,428 [Speaker 17]
on Santa Monica Boulevard from the 405
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:52,688 [Speaker 17]
Freeway to Centinela Avenue, and in our
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,798 [Speaker 17]
study, we recommend extending the reach of
00:37:54,848 --> 00:37:55,697 [Speaker 17]
that bus-only lane.
00:37:57,468 --> 00:37:59,568 [Speaker 17]
Um, of course, the Westside Cities Council
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:01,548 [Speaker 17]
of Governments is leading a separate
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:03,238 [Speaker 17]
effort called the Westside Bus Connection
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:06,318 [Speaker 17]
Program, that improves, uh, or it aims to
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,528 [Speaker 17]
improve bus service on three corridors,
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:10,268 [Speaker 17]
one of which is Santa Monica Boulevard,
00:38:10,648 --> 00:38:12,828 [Speaker 17]
within the city limits. Um, the COG is
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:15,408 [Speaker 17]
currently doing community engagement, uh,
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,128 [Speaker 17]
and our team will continue to work with
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:20,088 [Speaker 17]
the COG on this separate study. Um, but
00:38:20,128 --> 00:38:23,068 [Speaker 17]
ultimately, staff is prepared to, uh,
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:25,568 [Speaker 17]
continue on the design of the Santa Monica
00:38:25,628 --> 00:38:27,328 [Speaker 17]
Boulevard Safety Study once the
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,638 [Speaker 17]
engagement process of the COG project is
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,498 [Speaker 17]
completed, so it could all be coordinated
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:33,288 [Speaker 17]
together.
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:36,718 [Speaker 17]
So now the third bucket of improvements
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:38,388 [Speaker 17]
is, of course, the focus intersection
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,538 [Speaker 17]
improvements. I'm sure you're all seeing
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,738 [Speaker 17]
some of these diagrams. Um, so there's
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,698 [Speaker 17]
fourteen of these locations where we're
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:46,388 [Speaker 17]
recommending,
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:49,688 [Speaker 17]
uh, targeted improvements. They're very,
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:50,078 [Speaker 17]
um,
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,368 [Speaker 17]
cater or, or tailored to the intersection
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,768 [Speaker 17]
and some of the crash history we've seen.
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:58,208 [Speaker 17]
So I'm gonna walk just through three of
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,458 [Speaker 17]
them tonight, um, but I'm happy to take,
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,428 [Speaker 17]
uh, questions or discuss any of the other
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:04,908 [Speaker 17]
focus intersections as well. The first one
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,648 [Speaker 17]
is at 6th Street, so this is a downtown
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,248 [Speaker 17]
location with a lot of pedestrian
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:11,628 [Speaker 17]
activities. So here, we are recommending a
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:14,508 [Speaker 17]
new pedestrian scramble, uh, paired with
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,688 [Speaker 17]
a no right turn on red restriction. Again,
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,568 [Speaker 17]
heavy pedestrian activity that we've seen
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:21,588 [Speaker 17]
here. Um, we're including curb
00:39:21,648 --> 00:39:23,098 [Speaker 17]
extensions, as you can see in the number
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:26,328 [Speaker 17]
three. So that supports that near side bus
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:29,198 [Speaker 17]
stop at the southwest corner, and then a
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:31,218 [Speaker 17]
curb extension at the southeast corner as
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:34,468 [Speaker 17]
well. Uh, in the outline in number four,
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:35,968 [Speaker 17]
you could see the bike markings across the
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:38,128 [Speaker 17]
intersection. There's a bike lane here,
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,888 [Speaker 17]
so it supports getting the bike lane all
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:41,498 [Speaker 17]
the way to the intersection and getting
00:39:41,508 --> 00:39:43,968 [Speaker 17]
bicyclists through the intersection. And
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,958 [Speaker 17]
then a bus stop relocation, as you can
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:48,297 [Speaker 17]
see, indicated in number five, uh, working
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:51,068 [Speaker 17]
again with Big Blue Bus on the rerouting
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:54,838 [Speaker 17]
of Route one, so this supports, um, that
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:59,948 [Speaker 17]
effort. So Chelsea Avenue
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,808 [Speaker 17]
is the other, uh, area, uh, focus
00:40:02,848 --> 00:40:04,468 [Speaker 17]
intersection I wanna talk about, and this
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:07,028 [Speaker 17]
receives some of the most comments as a
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:09,538 [Speaker 17]
place to improve crossing conditions. Um,
00:40:09,588 --> 00:40:11,218 [Speaker 17]
I mentioned we did a lot of outreach, and
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:14,297 [Speaker 17]
a lot of it did focus here on Chelsea. Um,
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,778 [Speaker 17]
as we worked with McKinley Elementary
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:17,118 [Speaker 17]
School, we've had pop-up,
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,868 [Speaker 17]
uh, events at their Family Literacy Night
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:21,768 [Speaker 17]
and the World-- their World Heritage Day
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:24,968 [Speaker 17]
as well. Um, we did our walk audit, and
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,348 [Speaker 17]
this was one of the locations where our
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:28,488 [Speaker 17]
team went out there and observed sort of
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:32,408 [Speaker 17]
the behaviors. Um, we've talked a lot, uh,
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:34,028 [Speaker 17]
with Victor, the crossing guard here at
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:36,308 [Speaker 17]
this intersection. He just-- he's seen so
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:37,708 [Speaker 17]
much.
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:41,008 [Speaker 17]
And of course, we've observed, right?
00:40:41,028 --> 00:40:42,448 [Speaker 17]
We've, we've seen a lot of people cross
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:44,808 [Speaker 17]
the street here out of necessity. Uh, so
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:46,288 [Speaker 17]
at this location, we are recommending a
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:49,948 [Speaker 17]
new crosswalk with a pedestrian signal. So
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:52,328 [Speaker 17]
this crossing would be further reinforced
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:54,888 [Speaker 17]
with a median refuge island that allows
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:58,088 [Speaker 17]
both pedestrians and bicyclists to sort of
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:00,508 [Speaker 17]
get through that median refuge. Um, and
00:41:00,568 --> 00:41:03,328 [Speaker 17]
it does also limit the turning movements
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,648 [Speaker 17]
at this intersection, so the eastbound and
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:08,448 [Speaker 17]
westbound left turns would be limited, as
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:11,368 [Speaker 17]
well as the southbound left turn. Um,
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:13,808 [Speaker 17]
again, create, uh, creating an environment
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,968 [Speaker 17]
where there's fewer, uh, turning
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,267 [Speaker 17]
movements and fewer potential for
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:21,168 [Speaker 17]
conflict. Again, our goal here was really
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,168 [Speaker 17]
to improve crossing conditions and to get
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,508 [Speaker 17]
bicyclists safely through the intersection
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:27,608 [Speaker 17]
and get them on the pr-- bikeway network.
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:30,068 [Speaker 17]
We have a project on Broadway, where we
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:32,688 [Speaker 17]
wanna get bicyclists, uh, easily through,
00:41:32,808 --> 00:41:35,928 [Speaker 17]
um, onto their bike, the bikeway network.
00:41:36,008 --> 00:41:37,268 [Speaker 17]
And we've received a lot of positive
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,688 [Speaker 17]
feedback from the community on this
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,168 [Speaker 17]
design. I think what I hear a lot from the
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:43,068 [Speaker 17]
parents at McKinley is, "I wish it could
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:44,217 [Speaker 17]
be done today because
00:41:45,248 --> 00:41:47,228 [Speaker 17]
my kids are there right now."
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:50,848 [Speaker 17]
So the third example I'm gonna show today
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:53,608 [Speaker 17]
is at Princeton Street, and we know
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:55,948 [Speaker 17]
there's a recent crash here, and we
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:58,208 [Speaker 17]
realize that there's already a crosswalk
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,648 [Speaker 17]
here as well. Um, we do propose improving
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,717 [Speaker 17]
it with a landscape median refuge to,
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:05,787 [Speaker 17]
again, shorten those crossing distances
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,508 [Speaker 17]
and narrow that roadway space to, to make
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:13,028 [Speaker 17]
it, uh, feel and, and become a slower
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:15,568 [Speaker 17]
street. Uh, we also propose limiting the
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,458 [Speaker 17]
turning movements here with the landscape
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,508 [Speaker 17]
median and the right turn only from the
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:22,048 [Speaker 17]
side streets. Again, limiting the number
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:23,728 [Speaker 17]
of turning movements and potentials for
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:25,568 [Speaker 17]
conflict.
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,768 [Speaker 17]
Now, staff recommends that improvements
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:32,188 [Speaker 17]
are organized into two separate phases for
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,588 [Speaker 17]
implementation. Phase one could be
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:36,688 [Speaker 17]
implemented within two and a half to five
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:39,368 [Speaker 17]
years and planned with the repaving of
00:42:39,408 --> 00:42:41,748 [Speaker 17]
Santa Monica Boulevard. So our public
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:43,968 [Speaker 17]
works team that we've been working with,
00:42:44,068 --> 00:42:46,948 [Speaker 17]
um, they've prioritized Santa Monica
00:42:46,988 --> 00:42:50,788 [Speaker 17]
Boulevard as an area to repave, um, and
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:52,338 [Speaker 17]
coordinate those efforts so that we can
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:54,008 [Speaker 17]
get these phase one improvements on the
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:57,128 [Speaker 17]
ground. So in phase one, we would install
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,528 [Speaker 17]
all the necessary striping and bollards to
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,328 [Speaker 17]
enforce those right turns from the side
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:03,468 [Speaker 17]
streets. We could outline the curb
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:05,988 [Speaker 17]
extensions and introduce center line
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:07,548 [Speaker 17]
hardening, as you can see in the diagram
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,144 [Speaker 17]
here.... and that helps reduce those
00:43:10,184 --> 00:43:12,853 [Speaker 17]
turning speeds for drivers. Uh, we could
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:14,204 [Speaker 17]
add bikeway markings through the
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,214 [Speaker 17]
intersections, again, getting bicyclists
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:20,154 [Speaker 17]
onto the bikeway network. We could also,
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:22,424 [Speaker 17]
uh, include minor traf-- or changes to
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:24,364 [Speaker 17]
traffic signals, like implementing leading
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:26,564 [Speaker 17]
pedestrian intervals, uh, signal timing
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:28,044 [Speaker 17]
coordinations, and in particular,
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:30,744 [Speaker 17]
coordinating the area between 20th and
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:32,844 [Speaker 17]
26th Street.
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:36,524 [Speaker 17]
So that's phase one, and phase two
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:40,784 [Speaker 17]
requires more significant, uh, design and
00:43:40,844 --> 00:43:42,674 [Speaker 17]
civil engineering work since we're
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:46,224 [Speaker 17]
impacting curb lines, utilities, catch
00:43:46,244 --> 00:43:47,764 [Speaker 17]
basins, fire hydrants, those sorts of
00:43:47,804 --> 00:43:49,504 [Speaker 17]
things. So these projects would be
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,924 [Speaker 17]
implemented after phase one. So you do
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:52,524 [Speaker 17]
phase one,
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:54,504 [Speaker 17]
get it on the ground, and then you can
00:43:54,644 --> 00:43:57,744 [Speaker 17]
modify as needed, and that way, phase two
00:43:57,864 --> 00:44:01,124 [Speaker 17]
has a design that's sound and that we've
00:44:01,164 --> 00:44:03,924 [Speaker 17]
learned from. Phase two improvements could
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:05,924 [Speaker 17]
be implemented within three to ten years,
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:08,464 [Speaker 17]
and that includes some of our bigger
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:11,144 [Speaker 17]
ticket items, like new signals, left turn
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:14,403 [Speaker 17]
phasing, concrete curb extensions, uh,
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:18,144 [Speaker 17]
curb ramps, landscape median islands,
00:44:18,184 --> 00:44:20,604 [Speaker 17]
things like that. Phase two improvements
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:22,304 [Speaker 17]
for the entire corridor are estimated to
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:23,784 [Speaker 17]
cost around seven point two million
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:26,744 [Speaker 17]
dollars. So the scale and the cost of
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:29,714 [Speaker 17]
these phase two projects means we'd, uh,
00:44:29,824 --> 00:44:31,484 [Speaker 17]
need to find additional funding from
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:35,924 [Speaker 17]
local, uh, s-- or state or federal grants.
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:39,924 [Speaker 17]
So if adopted tonight, staff is ready to
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,764 [Speaker 17]
begin work on phase one for the
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,104 [Speaker 17]
improvements that include the signing,
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:46,134 [Speaker 17]
striping of the corridor, and of course,
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,304 [Speaker 17]
re- coordinating that with the repaving of
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:51,504 [Speaker 17]
Santa Monica Boulevard. So that effort
00:44:51,544 --> 00:44:52,484 [Speaker 17]
can begin immediately
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:55,704 [Speaker 17]
and can be projected to be completed
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:57,644 [Speaker 17]
before the Olympic and Paralympic Games
00:44:57,724 --> 00:44:59,324 [Speaker 17]
for phase one, as you can see at that top
00:44:59,364 --> 00:44:59,884 [Speaker 17]
bar.
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,200 [Speaker 0]
At the same time, staff, uh, will be
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,760 [Speaker 0]
applying to the Statewide Active
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,720 [Speaker 0]
Transportation Program for phase two, and
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,960 [Speaker 0]
that includes all the concrete work, um,
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,700 [Speaker 0]
at those focus intersections that I had
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,140 [Speaker 0]
mentioned, uh, with the application being
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,300 [Speaker 0]
submitted this June. And if awarded, we
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,160 [Speaker 0]
anticipate going through the process to
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,480 [Speaker 0]
accept funds and begin on the design for
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,940 [Speaker 0]
phase two in the summer of next year. And
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,080 [Speaker 0]
if that timeline holds, construction can
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,560 [Speaker 0]
begin in the winter of twenty
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,340 [Speaker 0]
twenty-eight, twenty-nine.
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,280 [Speaker 0]
Again, I, I'm happy to be here. Um, I just
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900 [Speaker 0]
wanna thank our stakeholders who are
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,400 [Speaker 0]
listening, who have supported us
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,100 [Speaker 0]
throughout this whole process, our
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,280 [Speaker 0]
consultant team, our city departments, who
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,480 [Speaker 0]
have been a part of this project from the
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,990 [Speaker 0]
beginning. Uh, so with that, I'm happy to
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,560 [Speaker 0]
take any questions you might have. Thank
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,560 [Speaker 0]
you.
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,860 [Speaker 1]
Thank you. Do folks wanna get in the queue
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,700 [Speaker 1]
with questions?
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,589 [Speaker 1]
Okay.
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,020 [Speaker 1]
Council Member Zot.
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,420 [Speaker 2]
Thanks so much for this. Um,
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,640 [Speaker 2]
excited for many of these improvements,
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,120 [Speaker 2]
uh, to become a reality and appreciate all
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,280 [Speaker 2]
the work that's been done thus far. Can't
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,540 [Speaker 2]
believe it was twenty twenty-four when we
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,640 [Speaker 2]
started talking to people about this. Um,
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,110 [Speaker 2]
I have a couple questions. Um,
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,480 [Speaker 2]
excuse me, um, bear with me as I go
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400 [Speaker 2]
through this because it was a long report,
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,920 [Speaker 2]
and I'm still digesting it myself. Um,
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,790 [Speaker 2]
first of all, I just wanna say again, I
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,190 [Speaker 2]
appreciate the work that's been done. I
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,520 [Speaker 2]
also especially appreciate the treatment
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,770 [Speaker 2]
on Chelsea. Um, as you highlighted, um,
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,340 [Speaker 2]
I would love for it to happen in the next
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,800 [Speaker 2]
five years, uh, like the parents who, who
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,920 [Speaker 2]
said the same. Um, so I'm, I'm concerned
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,280 [Speaker 2]
that it's, that it's slated to happen not,
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320 [Speaker 2]
you know, for at least five years. But,
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,680 [Speaker 2]
um,
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,740 [Speaker 2]
beyond that, um, I wanted to just
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,880 [Speaker 2]
speak to a couple of things and ask
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,700 [Speaker 2]
questions. The first had to do with speed,
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,260 [Speaker 2]
um, um, on the corridor and efforts to
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,080 [Speaker 2]
reduce speeds. Um, I know that when we
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,920 [Speaker 2]
spoke in the summer of last year, we
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,380 [Speaker 2]
talked about reducing lane widths as one
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,100 [Speaker 2]
technique for reducing speeds on the
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,870 [Speaker 2]
corridor, especially, uh, in the sections
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,190 [Speaker 2]
where
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,760 [Speaker 2]
I think the eighty-fifth percentile speeds
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,840 [Speaker 2]
are between thirty-five and forty-nine
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,310 [Speaker 2]
miles an hour currently on the corridor.
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,500 [Speaker 2]
Um, can you go into which parts of
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,260 [Speaker 2]
the, um, plan involve reduced, um, lane
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,920 [Speaker 2]
widths? Um, because I, I seem to see
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,160 [Speaker 2]
several that, that seem still quite wide.
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,440 [Speaker 0]
Absolutely. So in that eastern segment,
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,370 [Speaker 0]
um, we have noticed that the eighty-fifth
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,500 [Speaker 0]
percentile of speeds is higher, so we have
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,380 [Speaker 0]
recorded sort of higher-speeding vehicles
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,580 [Speaker 0]
on the east. We also know that that's the
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,510 [Speaker 0]
segment of Santa Monica Boulevard that
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,640 [Speaker 0]
has the widest profile. So hearing
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,860 [Speaker 0]
feedback from the, um, study session back
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,840 [Speaker 0]
in June, we went back to the drawing board
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,460 [Speaker 0]
and looked at travel lanes, um,
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,580 [Speaker 0]
for those segments where we have the
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,980 [Speaker 0]
ability to narrow, uh, travel lanes in
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,000 [Speaker 0]
certain segments, and also at the entrance
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200 [Speaker 0]
and the departure of certain
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,740 [Speaker 0]
intersections, we're able to sort of
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,120 [Speaker 0]
stripe a fog line to delineate, better
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,410 [Speaker 0]
delineate and create just a narrow, uh, a
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,870 [Speaker 0]
narrow- narrower lane as drivers are
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,460 [Speaker 0]
traveling through the corridor. So that is
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,960 [Speaker 0]
one of the
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,280 [Speaker 0]
speed reduction strategies that we are
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,680 [Speaker 0]
implementing on the corridor, in
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,980 [Speaker 0]
particular in that eastern segment.
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,500 [Speaker 2]
Okay, um, I wanna just speak to a couple
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,880 [Speaker 2]
of sections that were pointed out to me
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,160 [Speaker 2]
where
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,440 [Speaker 2]
I guess from, from Twentieth to Chelsea,
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,860 [Speaker 2]
um, and from Chelsea to Twenty-sixth. I, I
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,320 [Speaker 2]
think I'm-- if I'm not mistaken, I'm
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640 [Speaker 2]
seeing lane widths that are still, like,
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680 [Speaker 2]
twelve and a half feet wide. Is that
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,060 [Speaker 2]
correct?
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,980 [Speaker 0]
Um, I'd have to pull up the
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,400 [Speaker 0]
AutoCAD, uh, of, of the existing lane
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,690 [Speaker 0]
widths there, um-
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,600 [Speaker 2]
I see five travel lanes of sixty-three
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,170 [Speaker 2]
fit- feet in width and no other, you know,
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,020 [Speaker 2]
improvements on that section. So I guess
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,820 [Speaker 2]
just sixty-three divided by five gets me
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,160 [Speaker 2]
to twelve point six as an average lane
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,560 [Speaker 2]
width. Does that sound correct?
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,280 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, and, and not all lane widths are
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,500 [Speaker 0]
sort of even, like, the, the
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,040 [Speaker 0]
number one lane is usually narrower, the
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,620 [Speaker 0]
number two lane is wider because it
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,860 [Speaker 0]
carries, um, transit buses who require a
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,280 [Speaker 0]
wider lane width, and then the parking
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,500 [Speaker 0]
lanes, whether they're there or not, they-
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,260 [Speaker 0]
those will also differ.
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,580 [Speaker 2]
Okay.
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,600 [Speaker 2]
But definitely more than, say, a ten-foot
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,600 [Speaker 2]
lane, for instance, it would seem.
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,950 [Speaker 2]
Okay, um,
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,170 [Speaker 2]
and then, uh,
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,430 [Speaker 2]
I guess I wanted to s- talk about the, the
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560 [Speaker 2]
second thing related to, uh, uh, the far
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,310 [Speaker 2]
siding of bus stops. That seems like a
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,540 [Speaker 2]
great practice, but I guess I didn't see
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,480 [Speaker 2]
it, um, implemented in all of the, the,
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,510 [Speaker 2]
the, the treatment or all of the potential
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,180 [Speaker 2]
stops. Um, uh, I'm thinking specifically,
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,450 [Speaker 2]
uh, one example being the, uh,
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,600 [Speaker 2]
uh, Twenty-sixth and Santa Monica
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,140 [Speaker 2]
intersection, I believe. I'm just curious
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,740 [Speaker 2]
as to why we didn't far side the bus stops
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,320 [Speaker 2]
in that intersection, for instance.
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,280 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, that's a great question. Uh, so at
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,710 [Speaker 0]
that, uh, intersection, the street, um,
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,860 [Speaker 0]
east of Twenty-sixth sort of widens up,
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,940 [Speaker 0]
and currently, there is a near side bus
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,680 [Speaker 0]
stop in the westbound direction, um, and
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,350 [Speaker 0]
then the near side bus stop is in the, um,
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000 [Speaker 0]
eastbound direction on the southwest
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,080 [Speaker 0]
corner. Um, so at that location, we
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,040 [Speaker 0]
propose, uh, for the southwest corner to
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,160 [Speaker 0]
have an expanded sidewalk area. As I had
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,300 [Speaker 0]
mentioned, there's certain areas where,
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,300 [Speaker 0]
um, the sidewalk space is, um, sort of at
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,200 [Speaker 0]
its minimum, and there are things like
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,812 [Speaker 0]
trees-... furniture, the bus stop itself.
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,432 [Speaker 0]
Um, so this was an opportunity to both
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,252 [Speaker 0]
expand the sidewalk and offer just a
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,962 [Speaker 0]
better, better pedestrian environment, um,
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:11,802 [Speaker 0]
and also allow for in-lane stops. Now, at
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,792 [Speaker 0]
the southwest corner in the southbound
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,452 [Speaker 0]
direction, there's also bus stop number
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,492 [Speaker 0]
forty-three. So for anyone making
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,572 [Speaker 0]
connections there, it makes it more
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:25,072 [Speaker 0]
convenient for, for, uh, bus patrons to
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,412 [Speaker 0]
just use or to stay sort of in that
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:30,142 [Speaker 0]
corner and be able to transfer. Um,
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:31,592 [Speaker 0]
so those are two
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,732 [Speaker 0]
main reasons why we proposed leaving that
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:38,252 [Speaker 0]
one nearside. Um, and then at the far side
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,592 [Speaker 0]
location, where Allen Jeffries Framing is
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,212 [Speaker 0]
currently,
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:43,572 [Speaker 0]
there is on-street parking, so
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:46,852 [Speaker 0]
moving it far side would, uh, potentially
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:49,972 [Speaker 0]
impact some of the parking, uh, there. Um,
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,472 [Speaker 0]
and instead, we propose a curb extension
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:56,412 [Speaker 0]
at that southeast corner, um, which again,
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,212 [Speaker 0]
shortens crossing distances, supports
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:01,601 [Speaker 0]
pedestrians, uh, but it can also, um,
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,992 [Speaker 0]
eliminate that northbound right turn lane,
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,592 [Speaker 0]
which then we can introduce a couple of
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,712 [Speaker 0]
more on-street parking spaces to support
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:09,792 [Speaker 0]
either
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:12,812 [Speaker 0]
parking, loading, other things that are
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,692 [Speaker 0]
sort of, uh, needed along the corridor.
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:21,882 [Speaker 2]
Got it. So, um, theoretically, you could
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:22,892 [Speaker 2]
do the bulb out on both
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:26,222 [Speaker 2]
sides, I imagine. Um, and theoretic- and,
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,782 [Speaker 2]
and seemingly, uh, we've added parking
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:30,032 [Speaker 2]
spaces at the same
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,172 [Speaker 2]
place that we're worried about taking them
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,452 [Speaker 2]
away?
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,452 [Speaker 0]
So theoretically, yeah, we can, um,
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,712 [Speaker 0]
move the stop far side. Yeah, and that
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,872 [Speaker 0]
was, um, staff's determination was to
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:45,392 [Speaker 0]
amplify the sidewalk space
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,412 [Speaker 0]
at the near side location.
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,872 [Speaker 2]
Right, but we could do both, right?
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,212 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, I believe so. If there aren't any
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:55,952 [Speaker 0]
driveway conflicts in the area, I believe
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:57,742 [Speaker 0]
we can. I'd have to look at the concept
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:57,762 [Speaker 0]
plans.
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:59,292 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, I mean, you said we were losing two
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,272 [Speaker 2]
parking spaces, but we're also gaining two
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,832 [Speaker 2]
parking spaces, it sounds like, on that
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:05,532 [Speaker 2]
same corner. Is that correct?
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,591 [Speaker 0]
Yeah.
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:10,432 [Speaker 2]
Okay. Um, and I, I, I assume the reason
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:11,992 [Speaker 2]
why we generally are trying to far side
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,812 [Speaker 2]
these bus stops is for the efficiency of
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,952 [Speaker 2]
the buses, correct? So that they can not
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:18,482 [Speaker 2]
stop at an intersection, face a light, and
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:21,252 [Speaker 2]
then have to wait again, you know, to go,
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:21,472 [Speaker 2]
right?
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:23,881 [Speaker 0]
That, and, um, you know, not have cars
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:25,192 [Speaker 0]
drive around and squeeze-
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:25,462 [Speaker 2]
Right
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,072 [Speaker 0]
... through and turn in front of them.
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,122 [Speaker 2]
Okay, thank you. Um,
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,452 [Speaker 2]
with the, uh,
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:38,132 [Speaker 2]
area, uh, uh, closer to
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:42,112 [Speaker 2]
downtown, I noted in the study that
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:45,012 [Speaker 2]
there's some-- some of the slowest bus
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:47,062 [Speaker 2]
speeds on the whole route are, are, are
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:49,252 [Speaker 2]
between, I think, Fourth and, and Lincoln.
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,592 [Speaker 2]
I think it said something between four
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,892 [Speaker 2]
and seven miles an hour at peak. Does that
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,532 [Speaker 2]
sound correct?
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:55,932 [Speaker 0]
Yeah.
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:58,952 [Speaker 2]
Was there any consideration of expanding
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,152 [Speaker 2]
the, uh, bus lane that currently exists, I
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:05,612 [Speaker 2]
think, uh, going westbound, sorry,
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,702 [Speaker 2]
eastbound, uh, currently stopping at
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,422 [Speaker 2]
Fourth Street and extending that to
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:12,852 [Speaker 2]
Lincoln Boulevard?
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,152 [Speaker 0]
Can you repeat the question just so I can
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:16,612 [Speaker 0]
visually-
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:17,152 [Speaker 2]
Yeah.
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,452 [Speaker 0]
-see it too.
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:20,302 [Speaker 2]
Um, so west, uh, eastbound traffic, uh,
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:22,552 [Speaker 2]
bus speeds are indicated to be between
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,852 [Speaker 2]
seven and four miles an hour at peak. Um,
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,472 [Speaker 2]
there's a bus-only lane
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,752 [Speaker 2]
that exists, but it stops at Fourth
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:31,952 [Speaker 2]
Street. Um, was there any consideration of
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,872 [Speaker 2]
continuing that bus-only lane to Lincoln
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,282 [Speaker 2]
due to the fact that this is the one of
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:37,452 [Speaker 2]
the slowest bus speed areas on the whole
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:38,752 [Speaker 2]
corridor?
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:42,112 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, that's a great, uh, question. We
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:45,832 [Speaker 0]
didn't, um, consider that particular
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:51,212 [Speaker 0]
design. Um, the eastbound, um, curbside
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:52,812 [Speaker 0]
lane from Ocean
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:55,652 [Speaker 0]
to Fourth is sort of, um, a transit plaza
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:57,652 [Speaker 0]
project that we know that it's been around
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:01,112 [Speaker 0]
for quite some time. Um, extending that,
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:02,852 [Speaker 0]
um, could be a consideration. I think the
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,972 [Speaker 0]
only trade-off there would be on-street
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,012 [Speaker 0]
parking for the segments, um, would be
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:11,092 [Speaker 0]
east of, uh, Fourth Street.
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,452 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. Okay. Um,
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,351 [Speaker 2]
lastly, I'm just curious, you know, again,
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:17,812 [Speaker 2]
because these eighty-fifth percentile
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,492 [Speaker 2]
speeds are very concerning to me. Um, were
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,272 [Speaker 2]
there any treatments that were
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,612 [Speaker 2]
considered? I know there were some
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:24,592 [Speaker 2]
lane
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:26,752 [Speaker 2]
narrowing, though there's other sections
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,482 [Speaker 2]
that I feel like they're still too wide.
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,722 [Speaker 2]
But were there any other treatments that
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,192 [Speaker 2]
were considered to reduce speeds, where
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:33,892 [Speaker 2]
currently they're, you know, in excess,
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,472 [Speaker 2]
obviously, of our speed limit, let alone
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:36,952 [Speaker 2]
at a safe speed, where someone were to
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,102 [Speaker 2]
collide, you know, with a bike or, or
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,172 [Speaker 2]
pedestrian? Are there any other treatments
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,192 [Speaker 2]
to reduce speed on that section?
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:45,812 [Speaker 0]
Absolutely. Um, at
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,622 [Speaker 0]
many of these locations, we've, uh,
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:52,592 [Speaker 0]
proposed median refuge islands, um, quite
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:53,252 [Speaker 0]
long
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,112 [Speaker 0]
and landscaped median refuge islands to
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,772 [Speaker 0]
narrow sort of the, the, the visual field,
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,292 [Speaker 0]
um, and create just a narrow profile,
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,132 [Speaker 0]
profile street. So instead of seeing a
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,272 [Speaker 0]
street that's, you know, seventy-eight
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,742 [Speaker 0]
feet wide, it'd be sort of half of that as
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,852 [Speaker 0]
somebody's driving down the intersection.
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:14,142 [Speaker 0]
So the median refuge islands, that's,
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,801 [Speaker 0]
that's one. Uh, curb extensions, um, that
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,632 [Speaker 0]
helps slow down right-turning drivers in
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,882 [Speaker 0]
particular, and also creates a narrower
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:24,572 [Speaker 0]
field of view at intersections. Uh, so
00:11:24,632 --> 00:11:25,742 [Speaker 0]
those are some of the things that we've
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,152 [Speaker 0]
done to slow down speeds, and we've been
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:31,792 [Speaker 0]
working with our, um, traffic team as well
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:34,592 [Speaker 0]
to do signal timing coordination, which
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,272 [Speaker 0]
is another element of this project, which
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,592 [Speaker 0]
can be timed in such a way to discourage
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,172 [Speaker 0]
speeding.
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,582 [Speaker 2]
Okay, last question: Are we at all
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:44,782 [Speaker 2]
concerned about the new, um, unsignali-
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,632 [Speaker 2]
uh, crossings that we're adding at
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,592 [Speaker 2]
unsignalized intersections? I mean, I know
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:50,952 [Speaker 2]
that's a treatment that we did, uh, at
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:52,652 [Speaker 2]
Wilshire, where it seems like a similar
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,922 [Speaker 2]
treatment here, where we are, as you said,
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:58,602 [Speaker 2]
adding some um, um, refuge islands and
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,402 [Speaker 2]
some, um, flashing, uh, I can't remember,
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:02,572 [Speaker 2]
RF-
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,402 [Speaker 0]
... RRFBs-
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:04,552 [Speaker 2]
RRFBs.
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,112 [Speaker 0]
Yes, flashing beacons.
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,952 [Speaker 2]
But we know that, that, you know, there
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:09,992 [Speaker 2]
have been pedestrian injuries and
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,372 [Speaker 2]
fatalities on Wilshire, you know, uh,
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:14,372 [Speaker 2]
since we did that exact treatment. I mean,
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,732 [Speaker 2]
are we concerned about adding new
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:19,202 [Speaker 2]
crossings, uh, at unsignalized
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,612 [Speaker 2]
intersections with just that same
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:21,112 [Speaker 2]
treatment?
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,072 [Speaker 0]
Well, as, as I mentioned, one of the main
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:26,632 [Speaker 0]
sort of, um, desires from the community
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,252 [Speaker 0]
were improved crossing conditions. Um,
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,152 [Speaker 0]
what we've seen out there today, in
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,332 [Speaker 0]
particular at Chelsea, uh, Avenue, is, you
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,802 [Speaker 0]
know, people are crossing the street
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:40,102 [Speaker 0]
where- wherever they need to. Um, and
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:43,772 [Speaker 0]
using federal highway guidance for,
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,162 [Speaker 0]
um, improving crossings at uncontrolled
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,512 [Speaker 0]
locations, these are the treatments that
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:49,892 [Speaker 0]
we are putting forward today, which fall
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:51,292 [Speaker 0]
in line with the guidance there, and
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,692 [Speaker 0]
support new pedestrian crossings.
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,692 [Speaker 2]
Chelsea is signalized, though, correct?
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,312 [Speaker 2]
That's the proposal.
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,432 [Speaker 0]
Chelsea is a pedestrian signal, correct.
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:03,392 [Speaker 2]
Signal, okay. Um, that's all for now.
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:04,012 [Speaker 2]
Thank you.
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,312 [Speaker 0]
Thank you.
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:07,472 [Speaker 1]
Great, so we have Council Member
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:11,192 [Speaker 1]
Zernatskaya. Snell, are you out now? Okay.
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:11,852 [Speaker 3]
No.
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:11,882 [Speaker 4]
I-
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:13,172 [Speaker 3]
Oh, I, I actually hit the wrong button.
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,812 [Speaker 1]
That's fine. Zernatskaya, then Snell, then
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:15,412 [Speaker 1]
Hall.
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:18,972 [Speaker 4]
Um, thank you. Just echoing the thanks for
00:13:19,052 --> 00:13:21,512 [Speaker 4]
all this work. I went to the September
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,952 [Speaker 4]
open house with my dog, and we had a lot
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:25,532 [Speaker 4]
of fun walking through all of the
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,992 [Speaker 4]
different little, uh, areas. And I
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,082 [Speaker 4]
apologize if anything that I'm asking has
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:32,652 [Speaker 4]
already been stated, I might have just
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,212 [Speaker 4]
missed it. So, um, starting with regarding
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:38,952 [Speaker 4]
the peak hour, uh, bus rapid transit
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:41,372 [Speaker 4]
lanes, could you confirm where we're
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:45,052 [Speaker 4]
contemplating putting those in? And, um,
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,412 [Speaker 4]
understanding that the Westside Cities COG
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:50,592 [Speaker 4]
is currently studying a bus rapid transit
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:53,232 [Speaker 4]
lanes, uh, along Santa Monica Boulevard,
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:56,592 [Speaker 4]
how easy or difficult would it be for us
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:59,632 [Speaker 4]
to potentially make changes to ours in the
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,362 [Speaker 4]
future, based on the results of that
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:02,772 [Speaker 4]
study?
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,392 [Speaker 0]
So to answer your first question, we're
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,872 [Speaker 0]
looking at implementing peak hour bus-only
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:10,712 [Speaker 0]
lanes from Princeton Street, uh, east
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,642 [Speaker 0]
towards the, uh, city limit, um,
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:15,752 [Speaker 0]
Sentinel Avenue, which would then link
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,912 [Speaker 0]
with the Caltrans project for bus-only
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:19,332 [Speaker 0]
lanes, so it'd be continuous throughout
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:23,792 [Speaker 0]
there. Um, and the second question is, how
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,552 [Speaker 0]
easy would it be to coordinate designs
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:28,252 [Speaker 0]
with the Westside Cities COG study? And
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:32,332 [Speaker 0]
our staff is, um, you know, involved in
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,832 [Speaker 0]
that project, and I think that the timing
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:38,492 [Speaker 0]
of this, um... On one hand, we have the
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:41,441 [Speaker 0]
opportunity to sort of work on,
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:41,941 [Speaker 0]
um,
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,512 [Speaker 0]
a timeline that's coordinated with public
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,881 [Speaker 0]
works for the repaving of it. At the same
00:14:46,912 --> 00:14:49,522 [Speaker 0]
time, we wanna make sure that it is, um,
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,752 [Speaker 0]
that it works with the Westside Cities COG
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:54,172 [Speaker 0]
study. Um, I think previously I'd been
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,032 [Speaker 0]
asked if any of these improvements sort of
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,312 [Speaker 0]
conflict with the potential for, uh,
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,312 [Speaker 0]
bus-only lanes
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:03,512 [Speaker 0]
west of Princeton, and the answer is no,
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,312 [Speaker 0]
because we still have to go in and sort of
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:09,232 [Speaker 0]
design, um, what the bus-only lane looks
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,252 [Speaker 0]
like, how it functions,
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:12,702 [Speaker 0]
and how it can be modified. Of course,
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,232 [Speaker 0]
with repaving, you don't want to, you
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:17,392 [Speaker 0]
know, stripe everything, re- repave,
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,092 [Speaker 0]
stripe, and then have a study come in much
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,632 [Speaker 0]
later and then say, "Actually, we're
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:23,912 [Speaker 0]
gonna re-stripe or redo some of the
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,432 [Speaker 0]
things." So we want those efforts to be
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,692 [Speaker 0]
coordinated.
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:29,572 [Speaker 4]
And do you happen to know how many, um,
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:34,432 [Speaker 4]
how many bus, uh, like, how many
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,272 [Speaker 4]
routes currently use Santa Monica
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:40,532 [Speaker 4]
Boulevard, including both Big Blue Bus,
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,002 [Speaker 4]
Metro, and any others?
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:45,612 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. R- uh, for the majority extent,
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,381 [Speaker 0]
it's, uh, Big Blue Bus Route
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:51,172 [Speaker 0]
1 and, uh, Rapid 10, which I believe is
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:54,112 [Speaker 0]
still, um, uh, in operation there, and
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,941 [Speaker 0]
then, uh, Metro Local Route 4. And then
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,472 [Speaker 0]
when you get towards the sort of transit
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:01,762 [Speaker 0]
plaza area, that's where
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:04,782 [Speaker 0]
every bus seems to stop there, making
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:06,562 [Speaker 0]
transfers and things like that, but it's
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,472 [Speaker 0]
usually just circulates there. But the
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,742 [Speaker 0]
extent of Santa Monica Boulevard, it's
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:11,692 [Speaker 0]
three lines.
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:14,032 [Speaker 4]
Okay. And could you please remind me where
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:16,432 [Speaker 4]
that plaza area is again?
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:19,511 [Speaker 0]
It's from Ocean Avenue to 4th Street.
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,792 [Speaker 4]
Okay. And what improvements are we
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:25,502 [Speaker 4]
thinking there to make it easier for all
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:27,972 [Speaker 4]
of the buses that stop there?
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:29,542 [Speaker 0]
That's a great question. We've actually,
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:31,772 [Speaker 0]
uh... We've been working with Big Blue Bus
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:35,932 [Speaker 0]
to reroute, um, Route 1 in particular.
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:38,542 [Speaker 0]
Um, so part of our improvements at the
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,432 [Speaker 0]
intersection for 6th Street, does have a
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,752 [Speaker 0]
bus that's a bus stop that's relocated, so
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,652 [Speaker 0]
that it can better sort of loop through
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,492 [Speaker 0]
that area. Um,
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,652 [Speaker 0]
that's as far as we've gone in terms of
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:53,622 [Speaker 0]
improving through this plan. Obviously,
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:55,292 [Speaker 0]
any other improvements down the line, this
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:57,081 [Speaker 0]
plan wouldn't preclude, you know,
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:58,862 [Speaker 0]
rerouting bus stops or anything like that,
00:16:58,872 --> 00:17:00,432 [Speaker 0]
and the transit plaza would still be in
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:01,312 [Speaker 0]
place.
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,952 [Speaker 4]
Okay. Thank you. And, and for the bus
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:06,202 [Speaker 4]
stops, including the ones we're relocating
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:08,172 [Speaker 4]
and the ones that are, uh, planned to
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,292 [Speaker 4]
remain in the same locations, are we also
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,102 [Speaker 4]
looking at physical improvements for the
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:15,272 [Speaker 4]
bus stops themselves, so folks waiting for
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:17,592 [Speaker 4]
the bus are protected from the elements,
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:17,912 [Speaker 4]
and
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,692 [Speaker 4]
all of those other wonderful things?
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:22,392 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. No, that's an excellent point, and I
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:23,892 [Speaker 0]
think that's something we just have to
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:26,412 [Speaker 0]
keep coordinating with, uh, Big Blue Bus.
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:30,932 [Speaker 0]
I did note that at Berkeley, um, the w-
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,472 [Speaker 0]
east, sorry, the westbound bus stop was
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,652 [Speaker 0]
relocated, and that was
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,312 [Speaker 0]
partially, um, due to wanting to install
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:40,112 [Speaker 0]
a, a new shelter, a new bus stop furniture
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:42,392 [Speaker 0]
there. And they, you know, contacted us
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:44,072 [Speaker 0]
and said, "What's your plan for Berkeley?"
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:44,592 [Speaker 0]
We said,
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,552 [Speaker 0]
"Relocate the bus stop," and it was done.
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,802 [Speaker 0]
So those efforts are coordinated, um, to
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,472 [Speaker 0]
the extent that we can, you know, move bus
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:55,092 [Speaker 0]
stop or furniture in those shelters,
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,312 [Speaker 0]
things like that. I think that's to, to be
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,512 [Speaker 0]
determined with BBB.
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,072 [Speaker 4]
Got it. And that... And to make sure I'm
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:04,292 [Speaker 4]
understanding correctly, that does also
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,922 [Speaker 4]
include improving the, the furniture and
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,512 [Speaker 4]
the physical aspects of it, to have actual
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:13,212 [Speaker 4]
covers and, and everything like that?
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,081 [Speaker 0]
To, to the extent it's feasible working
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,052 [Speaker 0]
with Big Blue Bus, and the, the furniture
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:18,612 [Speaker 0]
available, and those types, sorts of
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,312 [Speaker 0]
things, yeah.
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,764 [Speaker 4]
... and then, um, I, I believe we've
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:25,484 [Speaker 4]
discussed it up here before, but could you
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:27,664 [Speaker 4]
please confirm if we're also planning on
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,864 [Speaker 4]
eliminating, uh, quote, unquote, "beg
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:32,804 [Speaker 4]
buttons" for pedestrian crossings and for
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,664 [Speaker 4]
bikeway crossings, and instituting some
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,644 [Speaker 4]
sort of, uh, more automatic or motion
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:40,744 [Speaker 4]
sensor, whatever technology there is, to
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:42,344 [Speaker 4]
make it easier for pedestrians to cross
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,084 [Speaker 4]
without having to press a button?
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,384 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Yeah, and I think the, um, the, the
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,124 [Speaker 0]
science behind, uh, you know, signal
00:18:50,184 --> 00:18:51,964 [Speaker 0]
timing is, is something I'm just still
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,564 [Speaker 0]
learning more and more about every day.
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:54,124 [Speaker 0]
And, and
00:18:54,764 --> 00:18:56,584 [Speaker 0]
really, the focus of this project and some
00:18:56,624 --> 00:18:58,064 [Speaker 0]
of the recommendations we have in here
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:01,344 [Speaker 0]
are to, to improve, um, audible signals
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:04,984 [Speaker 0]
for sight-impaired pedestrians. So we do
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:08,104 [Speaker 0]
recommend, uh, audible pedestrian signals,
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,804 [Speaker 0]
which means, um, you know, a, a, a
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:14,024 [Speaker 0]
vision-impaired person can press a button,
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:16,044 [Speaker 0]
and then they- it'll indicate sort of
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,984 [Speaker 0]
where the location, whether they have a
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:21,764 [Speaker 0]
wait or a walk signal, and then the t- the
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:23,754 [Speaker 0]
countdown. Uh, so those are things that
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:26,114 [Speaker 0]
we are recommending. Now, some of these
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:28,324 [Speaker 0]
locations would be on recall, where you
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,044 [Speaker 0]
don't have to press the button. Um, but we
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,644 [Speaker 0]
are recommending the audible portion of
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,904 [Speaker 0]
it through this plan because that's
00:19:35,944 --> 00:19:37,504 [Speaker 0]
something that, again, supports pedestrian
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:38,704 [Speaker 0]
crossings.
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:42,504 [Speaker 4]
So would it be that the, that they're
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,004 [Speaker 4]
automatic, but there is a button just so
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:48,084 [Speaker 4]
that there's a speaker for better ADA
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,364 [Speaker 4]
access?
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:51,224 [Speaker 0]
Correct. That, that's how I understand it,
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:53,744 [Speaker 0]
is there... For the most- at most- of
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:56,274 [Speaker 0]
many locations, they kinda be automatic,
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,644 [Speaker 0]
where you don't have to press the button,
00:19:57,704 --> 00:20:00,044 [Speaker 0]
but the button is there for an audible
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:02,284 [Speaker 0]
component. And there may be times of day
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,584 [Speaker 0]
where the pedestrian signal is timed,
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,544 [Speaker 0]
where you may have to press the button,
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:09,564 [Speaker 0]
and that is based on, again, some of the
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:11,184 [Speaker 0]
traffic engineering and the signal
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:11,844 [Speaker 0]
lengths.
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:14,804 [Speaker 4]
Is there a way that they, that during
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:16,624 [Speaker 4]
those times, they wouldn't actually
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,214 [Speaker 4]
physically have to press a button, and
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:21,314 [Speaker 4]
there would be some sort of, um, detector
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,204 [Speaker 4]
or sensor that would know there's somebody
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,264 [Speaker 4]
waiting to cross?
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,904 [Speaker 5]
Uh, hi, uh, Kyle Kozar, Principal
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:30,824 [Speaker 5]
Transportation Planner. Thank you, all,
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:35,004 [Speaker 5]
Council. Um, yeah, so, uh, we would, but,
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,244 [Speaker 5]
like, those recall periods would be
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,794 [Speaker 5]
during, like, coordinated periods of...
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:42,844 [Speaker 5]
So, um, on some signals, where it's a lot
00:20:42,924 --> 00:20:45,984 [Speaker 5]
of pedestrian traffic, downtown and things
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:47,604 [Speaker 5]
like that, then yeah, it could al- be
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:49,634 [Speaker 5]
always on recall. And there's some other
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:51,704 [Speaker 5]
places where, you know, if you're only
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:52,184 [Speaker 5]
getting
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:55,444 [Speaker 5]
kind of maybe one or two or three
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:58,914 [Speaker 5]
pedestrians an hour or something, then,
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,924 [Speaker 5]
you know, on off-peak times when there's
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,544 [Speaker 5]
not a lot of volume, they could be in
00:21:02,584 --> 00:21:04,164 [Speaker 5]
recall when it's coordinated with that.
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:06,644 [Speaker 5]
And then, like, in off-peak times, like
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,424 [Speaker 5]
late at night or something, they might not
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,264 [Speaker 5]
be because, um,
00:21:11,524 --> 00:21:13,024 [Speaker 5]
because, you know, there's questions
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,734 [Speaker 5]
about, you know, vehicles might get
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,053 [Speaker 5]
frustrated. They're sitting there, then
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,374 [Speaker 5]
they start running red lights if they're
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,754 [Speaker 5]
waiting and there's nobody there. And so,
00:21:19,784 --> 00:21:21,784 [Speaker 5]
you know, there is a, a science to
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,904 [Speaker 5]
finding, using data, kinda where it makes
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,424 [Speaker 5]
sense and what times of day you wanna do
00:21:25,444 --> 00:21:27,084 [Speaker 5]
that, so that it doesn't leave to other
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:28,214 [Speaker 5]
unintended consequences.
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,744 [Speaker 4]
But there's nothing that would just have a
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,684 [Speaker 4]
sensor so that somebody doesn't have to
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,194 [Speaker 4]
physically-
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:33,264 [Speaker 5]
Oh-
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:34,784 [Speaker 4]
... touch a button, or there is?
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:34,854 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:35,044 [Speaker 4]
Okay.
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:35,684 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, exactly.
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:36,154 [Speaker 4]
And that's-
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,384 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, that's what the recall would be. So
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:40,944 [Speaker 5]
it would automatically, um... You know,
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:42,804 [Speaker 5]
you wouldn't have to-- It would sense you
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:44,484 [Speaker 5]
and could do that.
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:44,984 [Speaker 4]
Okay. It-
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,564 [Speaker 5]
But it would, it would not always be
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,684 [Speaker 5]
automatic at every location, if that makes
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,664 [Speaker 5]
sense.
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:50,864 [Speaker 4]
Why?
00:21:50,904 --> 00:21:52,304 [Speaker 5]
Because, so like, for instance, if you
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:52,724 [Speaker 5]
were
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:56,144 [Speaker 5]
at an intersection where, you know, the
00:21:56,204 --> 00:21:59,324 [Speaker 5]
data shows that pedestrian activity is way
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,204 [Speaker 5]
lower, say, late at night, uh, and then
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,304 [Speaker 5]
every tra- time the traffic signal went,
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:07,384 [Speaker 5]
it went into, um, a, like, some pedestrian
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:09,864 [Speaker 5]
phase or something when it's not called,
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,264 [Speaker 5]
then, uh,
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:14,904 [Speaker 5]
then, you know, drivers can sit there,
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,904 [Speaker 5]
there's nobody there. They might be
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,204 [Speaker 5]
waiting unnecessarily, and then it leads
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,414 [Speaker 5]
to-- it can lead to, like, other
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,204 [Speaker 5]
frustrations and things like that. So we
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:24,514 [Speaker 5]
can coordinate that, that, uh,
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:27,074 [Speaker 5]
functionality you want, using data with
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:29,484 [Speaker 5]
the right times of day when it can be
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:30,724 [Speaker 5]
implemented, if that makes sense.
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:30,734 [Speaker 4]
It's-
00:22:30,744 --> 00:22:32,074 [Speaker 5]
When it's most advantageous.
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:33,984 [Speaker 4]
Okay, thank you. And, and that's something
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,463 [Speaker 4]
that we have just ongoing control over,
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,364 [Speaker 4]
so that's something we could change when-
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,144 [Speaker 5]
We're working on it. So we've been
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:41,764 [Speaker 5]
upgrading all of the traffic signals to
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:44,384 [Speaker 5]
new technology and new software. Our
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,724 [Speaker 5]
traffic engineer's not here, so I can't
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,204 [Speaker 5]
say exactly where we are, but they've been
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:49,214 [Speaker 5]
making incredible progress. And as we do
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,764 [Speaker 5]
that, then the functionality to be able to
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:52,194 [Speaker 5]
do those things and coordinate them
00:22:53,024 --> 00:22:55,594 [Speaker 5]
is gonna be able to do it, yeah.
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:58,844 [Speaker 4]
That sounds very exciting. Thank you. Um,
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,664 [Speaker 4]
and then, so I, I wanted to get some
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,304 [Speaker 4]
clarification for the, uh, currently
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:06,204 [Speaker 4]
unsignalized intersections and the
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:08,574 [Speaker 4]
intersections where we're putting in
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:11,454 [Speaker 4]
unsignalized intersections or planning to:
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:11,814 [Speaker 4]
Um,
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:14,764 [Speaker 4]
are there also going to be lights on the
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,904 [Speaker 4]
actual street in the crosswalks that we're
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:18,484 [Speaker 4]
putting or just on the sides?
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:21,684 [Speaker 0]
Um, are you referring to, like, the
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,224 [Speaker 0]
embedded-on-the-ground-
00:23:23,364 --> 00:23:23,374 [Speaker 4]
Yes
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:23,594 [Speaker 0]
... sort of-
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:23,694 [Speaker 4]
Yeah
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,764 [Speaker 0]
... flashing beacons? Um, I, I believe
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,164 [Speaker 0]
we've tested or
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,904 [Speaker 0]
done those at a couple of intersections
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:32,664 [Speaker 0]
with not much success, um, in terms of
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,884 [Speaker 0]
maintenance and-
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:34,924 [Speaker 3]
We phased them out.
00:23:34,944 --> 00:23:37,084 [Speaker 0]
We phased them out, essentially, um, and
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,824 [Speaker 0]
instead favour sort of the flashing
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,364 [Speaker 0]
beacons above. Um, we have looked at
00:23:41,424 --> 00:23:44,724 [Speaker 0]
vendors that, um, have equipment where the
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,944 [Speaker 0]
flashing beacons can be located on mast
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,624 [Speaker 0]
arms. So basically, instead of just at the
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,104 [Speaker 0]
corner where the sidewalk is, uh, a
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,944 [Speaker 0]
larger mast arm, where it can be in lane,
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:56,924 [Speaker 0]
so that drivers are seeing the flashing
00:23:56,984 --> 00:24:00,204 [Speaker 0]
beacon right in front of them. Um, there's
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,324 [Speaker 0]
numerous examples, um,
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:04,934 [Speaker 0]
in, in throughout our, I think, our
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:05,644 [Speaker 0]
neighbouring city-
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:05,934 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,124 [Speaker 0]
... Los Angeles. Like in the Venice
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,564 [Speaker 0]
neighbourhood, there's a couple out there
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,804 [Speaker 0]
I took photos of. So that is some of the
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,314 [Speaker 0]
equipment that we're looking at, uh,
00:24:12,324 --> 00:24:14,264 [Speaker 0]
primarily because we phased out the sort
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:16,564 [Speaker 0]
of in-the-ground flashers.
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:18,604 [Speaker 4]
Did we phase those out because they were
00:24:18,644 --> 00:24:20,124 [Speaker 4]
just too expensive to maintain and
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:20,804 [Speaker 4]
weren't-
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:21,124 [Speaker 0]
Yeah
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:22,504 [Speaker 4]
... effective or?
00:24:23,344 --> 00:24:25,324 [Speaker 0]
... Yeah, they, they, they break very
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:27,004 [Speaker 0]
easily with the nature of where they are.
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:28,684 [Speaker 0]
They're very costly and expensive to
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:30,344 [Speaker 0]
maintain, and it's, like, a ton of work.
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:33,064 [Speaker 0]
And so, uh, we had two actually on Santa
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,254 [Speaker 0]
Monica Boulevard, I believe it was at,
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,524 [Speaker 0]
like, 15th or 16th or something like that,
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:39,584 [Speaker 0]
and maybe 18th, and, you know, it was
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,504 [Speaker 0]
just in a constant state of disrepair. And
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:43,864 [Speaker 0]
so it's just
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,164 [Speaker 0]
been a very challenging thing to implement
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,064 [Speaker 0]
more of those. And then every time you
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:50,224 [Speaker 0]
repave, too, then it's a whole other thing
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:51,664 [Speaker 0]
and a whole other level of maintenance
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:52,954 [Speaker 0]
and challenge with reinstalling.
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:54,364 [Speaker 4]
So it sounds like, it sounds like the
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:56,844 [Speaker 4]
cost-benefit analysis just isn't there.
00:24:56,904 --> 00:24:58,394 [Speaker 4]
Okay, thank you for that clarification.
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:58,484 [Speaker 0]
Yeah.
00:24:58,524 --> 00:25:02,094 [Speaker 4]
And, um, one last question. So I
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,084 [Speaker 4]
understand the prioritization of phase one
00:25:04,124 --> 00:25:05,794 [Speaker 4]
to phase two to implement these
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:08,264 [Speaker 4]
quick-build improvements using paint,
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:11,144 [Speaker 4]
bollards, and the like. Would you be able
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:15,624 [Speaker 4]
to clarify how we could u- utilize paint
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:17,604 [Speaker 4]
and how we're planning to, to create
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,773 [Speaker 4]
visual cues for drivers to encourage them
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:24,064 [Speaker 4]
to drive at safer speeds?
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:29,504 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, um, so the str- the striping that's,
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:31,434 [Speaker 0]
uh, shown in some of these, uh, sort of
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:34,204 [Speaker 0]
diagrammatic intersections, um, in
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:38,344 [Speaker 0]
particular at, um, at the corners of
00:25:38,384 --> 00:25:40,624 [Speaker 0]
intersections where there's sort of like,
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:43,144 [Speaker 0]
you know, no space because it's a red curb
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:44,924 [Speaker 0]
or something like that, uh, these are
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:47,524 [Speaker 0]
areas that we, uh, find opportunities to
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:50,144 [Speaker 0]
improve, like the daylighting, uh, using
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,624 [Speaker 0]
paint and bollards in some instances. I
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:54,064 [Speaker 0]
think there's some good examples out in
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,864 [Speaker 0]
Pico, uh, Boulevard of a recent project we
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:59,044 [Speaker 0]
did there, where, um, there's just a lot
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,224 [Speaker 0]
of opportunities to use paint and bollards
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:04,344 [Speaker 0]
and signs to, again, implement those
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:05,704 [Speaker 0]
measures to
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,424 [Speaker 0]
narrow the field, create more organization
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:11,184 [Speaker 0]
on the street, and delineate travel
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,344 [Speaker 0]
lanes.
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,764 [Speaker 4]
And do we also utilize things like optical
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:17,404 [Speaker 4]
illusions to try to, you know, to make a
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:19,064 [Speaker 4]
driver think, "Oh, there is a bump there,"
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:20,524 [Speaker 4]
but there actually isn't a bump, it just
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:22,094 [Speaker 4]
looks like that because of the paint, and
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:22,684 [Speaker 4]
they slow down?
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,064 [Speaker 0]
That's a good question, and, and I think
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,514 [Speaker 0]
the only one I'm familiar with are, are,
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,464 [Speaker 0]
are mainly diagonal lines that sort of
00:26:29,664 --> 00:26:33,193 [Speaker 0]
veer drivers away from sidewalks or cur--
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:36,024 [Speaker 0]
corners or things like that, um, as well
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:38,584 [Speaker 0]
as, uh, re- reflective pavement markers.
00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:41,444 [Speaker 0]
Again, if you drive on, on Pico Boulevard
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:43,584 [Speaker 0]
tonight, you'll see a lot of that, um-
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:43,774 [Speaker 4]
Yeah
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:46,184 [Speaker 0]
... a lot of reflectors. So the street's
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,524 [Speaker 0]
lit up, right? And it's fairly lower
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,364 [Speaker 0]
maintenance, um, as opposed to, like, you
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,124 [Speaker 0]
know, lights throughout the medians and
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,524 [Speaker 0]
things like that. So those are some of the
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:57,044 [Speaker 0]
things that we can definitely implement
00:26:57,104 --> 00:26:57,974 [Speaker 0]
as part of this project.
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,544 [Speaker 4]
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:03,564 [Speaker 6]
Thank you.
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:03,584 [Speaker 4]
Yeah.
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,424 [Speaker 6]
I, I just have two quick questions. The
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,764 [Speaker 6]
first one you said is that phase two,
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:10,044 [Speaker 6]
you've, uh, applied for an application
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:13,744 [Speaker 6]
looking for funding to im- implement phase
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,364 [Speaker 6]
two of the project. Is that what my
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,584 [Speaker 6]
understanding is?
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,424 [Speaker 0]
That, that is our plan, uh, is to then
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:22,064 [Speaker 0]
apply for, uh, grant funding for phase
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:23,864 [Speaker 0]
two. So that would be sort of part of our
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:25,164 [Speaker 0]
next steps, if adopted.
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:26,924 [Speaker 6]
Next steps. So you haven't applied as of
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:27,424 [Speaker 6]
yet?
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:29,964 [Speaker 0]
We have not, because we, we need to adopt
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:31,124 [Speaker 0]
the plan to be able to
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,204 [Speaker 0]
then apply for funding to build the
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:35,704 [Speaker 0]
elements in the, in the project.
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,244 [Speaker 6]
The reason I ask is because, uh, we, we
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:39,744 [Speaker 6]
got a lot of comments from the community
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:42,184 [Speaker 6]
regarding the, the, the Santa Monica
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:44,994 [Speaker 6]
Chelsea area with respect to that lighting
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,674 [Speaker 6]
there, the light there, which I think is
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:48,414 [Speaker 6]
a cr- you know, excellent idea. And I was
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:51,704 [Speaker 6]
just wondering, uh, in your
00:27:51,744 --> 00:27:53,664 [Speaker 6]
implementation, is there a way that we
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,224 [Speaker 6]
could, uh, speed up that particular
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:57,674 [Speaker 6]
project? Because I think that is a, a
00:27:57,804 --> 00:27:59,874 [Speaker 6]
strong safety measure. Is-- has there been
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,044 [Speaker 6]
any discussion about it?
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:02,344 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, there, there has been internal
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:04,714 [Speaker 0]
discussion about it. I think ultimately,
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:08,344 [Speaker 0]
that's an intersection that, um, you know,
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:11,244 [Speaker 0]
you, you can't sort of stripe a signal,
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,644 [Speaker 0]
right? You can't do, like, a, a quick
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:15,624 [Speaker 0]
treatment of, um, of a new pedestrian
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:16,704 [Speaker 0]
signal, and I think that
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,884 [Speaker 0]
implementing a new signal with new curb
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,864 [Speaker 0]
ramps, with the new crosswalk is sort of
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:23,104 [Speaker 0]
all in one package,
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,164 [Speaker 0]
and it gets quite expensive. So that's why
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:28,404 [Speaker 0]
we look for outside funding to leverage
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:30,344 [Speaker 0]
grants to be able to do that and implement
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:32,744 [Speaker 0]
that all. It's sort of labeled a phase
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:33,984 [Speaker 0]
two. It's not to say that it's not
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:36,324 [Speaker 0]
important, but just phase two is sort of
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:39,164 [Speaker 0]
our approach for going out and chasing
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:42,164 [Speaker 0]
money, getting money to then build sort of
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,924 [Speaker 0]
our, our more civil and engineering-heavy
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,384 [Speaker 0]
projects like that one.
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:48,034 [Speaker 6]
I'd be interested in keeping abreast of
00:28:48,084 --> 00:28:49,904 [Speaker 6]
what, what that project goes along, 'cause
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:50,804 [Speaker 6]
that's something... And then my last
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:51,744 [Speaker 6]
question, we heard from a,
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:54,804 [Speaker 6]
we heard from a public today regarding,
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:58,764 [Speaker 6]
um, the commercial businesses and how we,
00:28:58,864 --> 00:28:59,194 [Speaker 6]
um,
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:02,724 [Speaker 6]
introduce them to the new lanes going left
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,804 [Speaker 6]
onl- and going right only and these kind
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,424 [Speaker 6]
of things. And what have we done with
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,304 [Speaker 6]
respect to our businesses along Santa
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:11,524 [Speaker 6]
Monica to get them, uh, aware of what's
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:14,904 [Speaker 6]
going on and how they will, um,
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:16,944 [Speaker 6]
interact with their customers going in and
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,964 [Speaker 6]
out of their businesses?
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,624 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. So from the start of this project,
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:25,144 [Speaker 0]
we've, um, sort of set up our centralized,
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,274 [Speaker 0]
you know, project webpage where we have
00:29:27,344 --> 00:29:29,744 [Speaker 0]
all of our information. But we really
00:29:29,804 --> 00:29:33,284 [Speaker 0]
tried to reach out to businesses by both
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:35,314 [Speaker 0]
sending out, you know, the ten thousand
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:37,584 [Speaker 0]
postcards that I had mentioned, uh, at the
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:40,304 [Speaker 0]
beginning of the project. Um, we've done
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,664 [Speaker 0]
door knocking, um, on the corridor, and
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,924 [Speaker 0]
we've-- I'd say we've talked to six,
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:48,864 [Speaker 0]
seventy, eighty percent of the businesses
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:51,564 [Speaker 0]
there that were willing to engage with us,
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:53,624 [Speaker 0]
and we've left posters in certain
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:56,744 [Speaker 0]
businesses and cafes. So we certainly, you
00:29:56,804 --> 00:30:00,134 [Speaker 0]
know, want to talk to as many businesses
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,664 [Speaker 0]
and people as possible that would be, um,
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,714 [Speaker 0]
in- interested in the project and see how
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,824 [Speaker 0]
we can work together. Uh, those are some
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:10,184 [Speaker 0]
of the things we did, um, proactively so
00:30:10,204 --> 00:30:11,504 [Speaker 0]
that we can get the word out about the
00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:14,794 [Speaker 0]
project. Um, as you know, we had that
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:17,414 [Speaker 0]
Route 66 meeting that was, you know,
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:18,894 [Speaker 0]
publicized, social media,
00:30:19,644 --> 00:30:21,904 [Speaker 0]
again, our website, we have a newsletter,
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:24,064 [Speaker 0]
um, that, that goes out to our membership
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:26,364 [Speaker 0]
base as well. So w- we do our best to get
00:30:26,384 --> 00:30:28,404 [Speaker 0]
the word out, at least for sort of where
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:30,804 [Speaker 0]
the project is at and what phases it's in.
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:34,064 [Speaker 0]
Um, same for the intersection design. So
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,204 [Speaker 0]
we had, you know, this intersection design
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,384 [Speaker 0]
at the meeting on September. Uh, we
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:40,608 [Speaker 0]
posted that-... immediately after that
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:42,448 [Speaker 0]
meeting to our website, so we had that
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:45,188 [Speaker 0]
living, uh, on our web's project webpage,
00:30:45,228 --> 00:30:46,668 [Speaker 0]
and then, you know, in preparation for
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:49,948 [Speaker 0]
this, uh, item tonight, um, have sort of
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,808 [Speaker 0]
publicized as much as we can the designs
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,728 [Speaker 0]
of, of all the intersections.
00:30:55,768 --> 00:30:58,248 [Speaker 3]
Thank you.
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:01,748 [Speaker 1]
Councilor Rahall.
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,728 [Speaker 3]
Uh, thanks, staff, for bringing this study
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:07,998 [Speaker 3]
to us. Um, several questions here, and
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,768 [Speaker 3]
forgive me if I missed this in the
00:31:09,788 --> 00:31:12,288 [Speaker 3]
thousand-page report we had four days to
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,408 [Speaker 3]
look through. But did we look at reducing
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:16,988 [Speaker 3]
speed limits along any portion of Santa
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:19,538 [Speaker 3]
Monica Boulevard as part of the study?
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:22,048 [Speaker 0]
I believe the city, uh, recently conducted
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:30,848 [Speaker 0]
survey, um, maybe about two years ago. Uh,
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:31,268 [Speaker 0]
the blog
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,468 [Speaker 0]
post that Mia put together, um, on the
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:34,408 [Speaker 0]
city website, but
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:37,848 [Speaker 0]
streets where
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:41,288 [Speaker 0]
there were five mile per hour reductions.
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:44,308 [Speaker 0]
Uh, I- per hour
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,448 [Speaker 0]
on the
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:47,988 [Speaker 0]
western end
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,598 [Speaker 0]
and, um, um, am I remembering that
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:52,928 [Speaker 0]
correctly?
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,178 [Speaker 3]
I, I think so, but there-
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,618 [Speaker 0]
The, the team is verifying it. So this,
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:00,368 [Speaker 0]
the speed survey is the method by which we
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:03,208 [Speaker 0]
look at streets citywide and assess, you
00:32:03,248 --> 00:32:04,678 [Speaker 0]
know, based off, based off eighty-fifth
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:07,348 [Speaker 0]
percentile, and then based off engineering
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,838 [Speaker 0]
judgment, how we can sort of leave s-
00:32:09,868 --> 00:32:12,028 [Speaker 0]
posted speed limits where they're at or if
00:32:12,078 --> 00:32:15,008 [Speaker 0]
we decrease them by five miles per hour.
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:16,648 [Speaker 0]
Um, so we'll verify right now,
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,968 [Speaker 0]
uh, if that was the case.
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:22,508 [Speaker 3]
I'm seeing heads being shook
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:25,128 [Speaker 3]
in a negative.
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:31,808 [Speaker 1]
There are people with the speed.
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:34,788 [Speaker 3]
Okay, I'll assume no until I'm told
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,668 [Speaker 3]
otherwise. Um, the report states on page
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,688 [Speaker 3]
twenty-nine that, quote... Oh, sorry, go
00:32:39,728 --> 00:32:39,798 [Speaker 3]
ahead.
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:41,158 [Speaker 7]
Sorry, Councilor. I can just clarify that.
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:44,008 [Speaker 7]
We did confirm. So in the, as a... Sorry,
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:45,228 [Speaker 7]
Anuj Gupta, Director of the Department of
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:47,018 [Speaker 7]
Transportation. Great to see you all, and
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,348 [Speaker 7]
thank you for the support of this study.
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:51,248 [Speaker 7]
Um, we did look at every street in the
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,668 [Speaker 7]
city through the speed study a couple of
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,588 [Speaker 7]
years ago that Carlos referenced. Santa
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:56,017 [Speaker 7]
Monica Boulevard, based on the data in the
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,898 [Speaker 7]
speed study, um, was not one of the ones
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,668 [Speaker 7]
that was identified in the many, many
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:01,668 [Speaker 7]
miles of, uh, streets across the city for
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,548 [Speaker 7]
speed limit reductions. So a speed limit
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:05,428 [Speaker 7]
reduction has not been implemented as a
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:07,588 [Speaker 7]
result of that speed study, and a
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,048 [Speaker 7]
subsequent speed study would need to be
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:11,648 [Speaker 7]
conducted, um, in order to, to effectuate
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,508 [Speaker 7]
speed limit reductions. But it could be
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:15,198 [Speaker 7]
something, you know, that we take a look
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:16,528 [Speaker 7]
at going forward.
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,948 [Speaker 3]
Okay, thank you.
00:33:20,068 --> 00:33:23,488 [Speaker 3]
So the report states on page twenty-nine
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:25,628 [Speaker 3]
that, quote, "Vehicular operations should
00:33:25,648 --> 00:33:27,418 [Speaker 3]
be considered alongside crash data," end
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,638 [Speaker 3]
quote. Can you tell me where level of
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:32,668 [Speaker 3]
service falls in our priorities, uh, on
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:35,188 [Speaker 3]
the, on this project?
00:33:35,288 --> 00:33:38,428 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, absolutely. And, um, I think, you
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:41,517 [Speaker 0]
know, sa- safety is really the primary
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:44,938 [Speaker 0]
goal here, um, for this project. Um, at
00:33:44,968 --> 00:33:46,768 [Speaker 0]
the same time, I had mentioned balancing
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:49,858 [Speaker 0]
the needs of all users for this, um,
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:53,268 [Speaker 0]
multi-lane arterial that carries up to
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:55,088 [Speaker 0]
twenty-seven, twenty-eight thousand
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:58,148 [Speaker 0]
vehicles per day, buses, et cetera. So
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:03,568 [Speaker 0]
we use level of service as one of the sort
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,408 [Speaker 0]
of tools to understand how
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,028 [Speaker 0]
vehicle throughput, uh, interacts
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,588 [Speaker 0]
throughout the corridor, and
00:34:10,268 --> 00:34:12,737 [Speaker 0]
we're able to also use, you know, computer
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:15,608 [Speaker 0]
simulations to see when we have the
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,908 [Speaker 0]
proposed improvements at every
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:19,648 [Speaker 0]
intersection, what has that done to the
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,368 [Speaker 0]
corridor in terms of level of service
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,228 [Speaker 0]
degradation or improvement, et cetera. So
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:27,237 [Speaker 0]
that's how we've used level of service in
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:28,868 [Speaker 0]
this project.
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:31,168 [Speaker 3]
And were there any treatments rejected
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,538 [Speaker 3]
because of level of service, uh, and
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,488 [Speaker 3]
throughput decrease?
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:38,888 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, so the... Initially, we had
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,868 [Speaker 0]
considered, um, a
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:45,158 [Speaker 0]
scramble intersection at 20th Street, um,
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:47,598 [Speaker 0]
after visiting it during the, uh, one of
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:49,918 [Speaker 0]
the walk audits that we did. And at that
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:52,028 [Speaker 0]
location, we thought, well, there's, there
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,868 [Speaker 0]
may be sort of the land use that supports
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:56,848 [Speaker 0]
a lot of crossing movements. You have
00:34:56,888 --> 00:34:59,838 [Speaker 0]
medical centers, hotels, cafes, et cetera.
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,628 [Speaker 0]
Um, so this could be something we can
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:05,368 [Speaker 0]
look into, right? And I think that after
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:06,848 [Speaker 0]
looking into it and seeing
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,158 [Speaker 0]
sort of the, the trade-offs, which would
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:13,748 [Speaker 0]
be the sort of vehicle throughput impact,
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:16,808 [Speaker 0]
um, which would also affect bus operations
00:35:16,868 --> 00:35:19,948 [Speaker 0]
in that segment from 20th to Cloverfield,
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,437 [Speaker 0]
that's sort of the most congested part of
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:24,728 [Speaker 0]
the corridor, um, with the goal of sort
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:27,368 [Speaker 0]
of separating pedestrians crossing the
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:30,748 [Speaker 0]
street versus vehicles turning. Uh, our
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,908 [Speaker 0]
team ultimately did- recommends that left
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:37,128 [Speaker 0]
turn, um, signals at that... Or sorry,
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:40,978 [Speaker 0]
uh, um, left- protected left turns at that
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:41,788 [Speaker 0]
intersection
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,508 [Speaker 0]
can sort of achieve that same result,
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:47,248 [Speaker 0]
which is separate pedestrians crossing
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:50,078 [Speaker 0]
versus vehicles driving through, um, and
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:52,388 [Speaker 0]
does not have the same impact on the
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:55,208 [Speaker 0]
vehicle throughput as a full scramble
00:35:55,268 --> 00:35:57,058 [Speaker 0]
intersection would. So that was one
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,218 [Speaker 0]
instance where we had initially looked at
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:01,248 [Speaker 0]
it and said, "Let's go sort of run it
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:03,128 [Speaker 0]
through the simulation and see what
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,748 [Speaker 0]
degradation looks like, again, for both
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,428 [Speaker 0]
vehicles and for transit," and ultimately
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,948 [Speaker 0]
are recommending, uh, left turn signal
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,948 [Speaker 0]
phasing at that intersection to separate
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,428 [Speaker 0]
those vehicle-pedestrian conflicts, which
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,988 [Speaker 0]
was the main goal.
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:18,428 [Speaker 3]
Doesn't 20th Street already have left turn
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,868 [Speaker 3]
signal phasing?
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,968 [Speaker 0]
Not in all directions.
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:26,068 [Speaker 3]
Okay. What's the difference between left
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:28,748 [Speaker 3]
turn signal phasing and having protected
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:30,648 [Speaker 3]
left turn lanes? 'Cause 20th Street has
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,968 [Speaker 3]
left turn lanes in all directions.
00:36:33,028 --> 00:36:35,128 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. So it has, it has left turn lanes in
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:36,548 [Speaker 0]
all directions, but not protected left
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,128 [Speaker 0]
turn signals, so that left g- green arrow,
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:41,808 [Speaker 0]
essentially. So, um, it allows for
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,008 [Speaker 0]
vehicles to better time sort of oncoming
00:36:44,048 --> 00:36:46,638 [Speaker 0]
traffic. When you have a permissive, um,
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:48,868 [Speaker 0]
signal phase or just the green ball,
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:51,200 [Speaker 0]
you're sort of-... looking at oncoming
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,809 [Speaker 0]
traffic, but you're also checking over
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,040 [Speaker 0]
your shoulder to see if people are
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,630 [Speaker 0]
crossing, so this eliminates that.
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,560 [Speaker 3]
Okay. Um, with the proposed queue jump on,
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,800 [Speaker 3]
at 26th Street,
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,610 [Speaker 3]
will there ever be a time when a vehicle
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,800 [Speaker 3]
will have to take a right turn around the
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,860 [Speaker 3]
bus from that middle lane, or what is
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,900 [Speaker 3]
effectively the middle lane, or does the
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,060 [Speaker 3]
light turn red every time the bus stops
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,580 [Speaker 3]
there?
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,900 [Speaker 0]
That's a great question. I think the
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,940 [Speaker 0]
design is intended for vehicles to
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,220 [Speaker 0]
wait behind the bus
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,260 [Speaker 0]
and not turn right in front of them on the
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,600 [Speaker 0]
number one lane, which would be the
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,300 [Speaker 0]
middle lane, to, to your point. Um, in
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,020 [Speaker 0]
terms of signalization and, and how
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,320 [Speaker 0]
we m-- Yeah, that, that's a good question.
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,600 [Speaker 5]
That's a good question. We'd have to talk
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:40,750 [Speaker 5]
to-
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,530 [Speaker 0]
We'd have to talk to our, um,
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,480 [Speaker 0]
traffic, uh,
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,760 [Speaker 0]
person to see.
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,750 [Speaker 3]
Okay. I, I, I would assume that we're
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,140 [Speaker 3]
probably not timing a red light to the bus
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,960 [Speaker 3]
stopping at the bus stop, which means
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,840 [Speaker 3]
that we would effectively create a
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,640 [Speaker 3]
situation where a vehicle could be in that
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,760 [Speaker 3]
middle lane, I think you called it the
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,460 [Speaker 3]
number one lane, right? Where they would
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,520 [Speaker 3]
be turning right in front of the bus and
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,060 [Speaker 3]
thus have a reduced sight line to any
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,420 [Speaker 3]
pedestrians that are crossing, uh, at 26th
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,180 [Speaker 3]
Street, correct?
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,320 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, so any right-turning vehicles would
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,180 [Speaker 0]
turn right from the number two lane, so
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,120 [Speaker 0]
the lane closer to the curb.
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,760 [Speaker 3]
If they're following the law.
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,620 [Speaker 3]
But we know for a fact that that's not
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,360 [Speaker 3]
what happens at the intersection, right?
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,580 [Speaker 3]
I'll tell you, I've seen it many times.
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,140 [Speaker 3]
Okay. Um,
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,780 [Speaker 3]
okay, the, the bus-only lanes and the
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,370 [Speaker 3]
partial bus lanes... A- and sorry, I know
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,650 [Speaker 3]
you've been asked this two times now, but
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,070 [Speaker 3]
I still don't know if I fully understand,
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,010 [Speaker 3]
so maybe let me try back briefing here.
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,560 [Speaker 3]
Like, we are not including bus-only lanes
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,560 [Speaker 3]
west of Princeton because the Westside COG
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,720 [Speaker 3]
is conducting their own study to include
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,900 [Speaker 3]
full bus lanes at that point?
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,600 [Speaker 0]
Um, the, the recommendation that we have
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,020 [Speaker 0]
set forward is to include the bus-only
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,040 [Speaker 0]
lane east of Princeton, because the
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,870 [Speaker 0]
impacts are
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,340 [Speaker 0]
minimal as far as this safety study sort
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,509 [Speaker 0]
of has carried this project along the way,
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,840 [Speaker 0]
and knowing that we have the Westside COG
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,860 [Speaker 0]
study, uh, moving forward to look at sort
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,420 [Speaker 0]
of more in-depth, uh, transit analysis,
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,660 [Speaker 0]
uh, more so than this project could have
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,900 [Speaker 0]
taken on because it was primarily a safety
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,540 [Speaker 0]
focus. But
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,020 [Speaker 0]
Kyle, do you want to add some?
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,100 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, so, um, the Westside COG
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,420 [Speaker 5]
study, like Carlos said, so the trade-offs
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,860 [Speaker 5]
to fit a bus lane
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,080 [Speaker 5]
going west of there, um, are much more
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,180 [Speaker 5]
significant. And so, you know, they would
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,470 [Speaker 5]
need to be weighed in on by you all, in
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,600 [Speaker 5]
that it would require removing a tran- a
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,700 [Speaker 5]
travel lane in each direction on Santa
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,140 [Speaker 5]
Monica Boulevard. So at any point, kind
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,720 [Speaker 5]
of, you know, I think somebody had
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,180 [Speaker 5]
mentioned, um, uh, by the Transit Mall or
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,420 [Speaker 5]
just going east- eastbound behi- uh, from
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,460 [Speaker 5]
the Transit Mall, so from, uh, 5th Street
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,960 [Speaker 5]
to Lincoln or 7th or, or whatever it was,
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,990 [Speaker 5]
um, you know, so that, in that stretch as
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120 [Speaker 5]
well, one of the two travel lanes would
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,640 [Speaker 5]
have to be removed and be re- re-replaced
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,289 [Speaker 5]
by a, a transit lane. Um, and so in this
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,620 [Speaker 5]
study, focusing on, you know, primarily
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,410 [Speaker 5]
safety improvements and knowing that, uh,
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,560 [Speaker 5]
the Westside COG is gonna be studying and
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,040 [Speaker 5]
doing a feasibility analysis of all of
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,240 [Speaker 5]
that, um,
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,860 [Speaker 5]
uh, you know, so we, we kind of- we knew
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,670 [Speaker 5]
where it fit, where those trade-offs, you
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,800 [Speaker 5]
know, and, and they, they were gonna give
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,860 [Speaker 5]
us analysis of what those trade-offs were.
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,780 [Speaker 5]
And then, to make those decisions, you
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,660 [Speaker 5]
know, you all, as a deliberative body,
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,569 [Speaker 5]
would have to, you know, decide for a
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,720 [Speaker 5]
major corridor, you know, this- the, these
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,900 [Speaker 5]
are the trade-offs and that's what we
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,729 [Speaker 5]
wanna go with. And so we've been waiting
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,050 [Speaker 5]
for the Westside COG, Westside COG study,
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,720 [Speaker 5]
uh, to get their analysis of that, so
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,960 [Speaker 5]
that, you know, that decision can be made
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,860 [Speaker 5]
in a more deliberative way.
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,480 [Speaker 3]
Okay. And do we know when that study will
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,300 [Speaker 3]
be coming back to us?
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:01,900 [Speaker 5]
Um-
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,260 [Speaker 0]
Later.
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,979 [Speaker 5]
Uh, no. So I, I think, um,
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,180 [Speaker 5]
we're waiting now to figure out when
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,700 [Speaker 5]
exactly we're gonna get the initial ten
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,120 [Speaker 5]
percent design. So they're doing a process
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,550 [Speaker 5]
by which they will be developing, or
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,960 [Speaker 5]
they're in the process of developing,
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,620 [Speaker 5]
like, ten percent designs and the initial
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,480 [Speaker 5]
feasibility analysis, and kind of their
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,820 [Speaker 5]
recommendations, their consultant team
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,910 [Speaker 5]
recommendations. Um, and I think at that
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,960 [Speaker 5]
point would be a good time to, uh, you
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,410 [Speaker 5]
know, have you all look at that. Um, um,
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,980 [Speaker 5]
and so the, the path at which that
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,320 [Speaker 5]
happens, I'm, you know, uh, we don't have
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,400 [Speaker 5]
that. So, you know, whether it's like you
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,580 [Speaker 5]
direct us to come back, or if we need to
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,020 [Speaker 5]
schedule a study session or whatever it
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,320 [Speaker 5]
might be, um, to present that information,
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,980 [Speaker 5]
I think that the consultant team that's
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,800 [Speaker 5]
doing that also would c- could come and
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,560 [Speaker 5]
present their findings and whatever their
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,520 [Speaker 5]
initial recommendations are. Um, and then
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,940 [Speaker 5]
the decision would have to be made by you
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,680 [Speaker 5]
all on those kind of big trade-offs for
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,900 [Speaker 5]
this street.
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,760 [Speaker 3]
Got it. Thank you. Um-
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,460 [Speaker 5]
But, but... And the last thing I would say
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,950 [Speaker 5]
is, you know, our inter- and so that,
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,940 [Speaker 5]
they are producing those kind of ten
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,780 [Speaker 5]
percent concept designs, that we can check
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,940 [Speaker 5]
in with them after this. On like, you
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,460 [Speaker 5]
know, at what point would that be ready
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,860 [Speaker 5]
for that? Um,
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,780 [Speaker 5]
and then could communicate that back to
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,200 [Speaker 5]
you all on, on how that works. Um, there
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,920 [Speaker 5]
is a timing question because... And so,
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,500 [Speaker 5]
you know, we'd probably wanna have that
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,700 [Speaker 5]
happen as soon as we can, because if you
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,740 [Speaker 5]
saw the, um-
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,160 [Speaker 3]
Yeah.
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,500 [Speaker 5]
You know, our intent is to move quickly
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,760 [Speaker 5]
with the plan, um, and implementing it,
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,000 [Speaker 5]
assuming, you know, I don't wanna be too
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,780 [Speaker 5]
presumptuous. Assuming that we have an
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,550 [Speaker 5]
adopted plan and are given direction to
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,300 [Speaker 5]
move forward, you know, um, Public Works
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,110 [Speaker 5]
is, uh,
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,410 [Speaker 5]
queuing up Santa Monica Boulevard for
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,980 [Speaker 5]
re-striping in 2027. That means we need to
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,310 [Speaker 5]
start working on implementing design, um,
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,630 [Speaker 5]
and that means we would wanna get all
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,310 [Speaker 5]
those sorts of details weighed out on what
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,670 [Speaker 5]
we are designing. Um-... that would be,
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,470 [Speaker 5]
like, the most efficient way to do that
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,490 [Speaker 5]
and meet those deadlines or laid out here.
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,890 [Speaker 5]
Um, and then it wouldn't preclude us from
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,180 [Speaker 5]
beginning our grant applications, uh,
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,000 [Speaker 5]
that would start and be, uh,
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,290 [Speaker 5]
submitted in June.
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:20,270 [Speaker 3]
Okay. On the pedestrian push buttons,
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,050 [Speaker 3]
um, Council Member Zern Sky had some
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,210 [Speaker 3]
really great questions there. Um, but I
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,290 [Speaker 3]
didn't hear you answer why wouldn't we
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,710 [Speaker 3]
just have the pedestrian recall with
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,210 [Speaker 3]
audible noises automatically?
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:34,210 [Speaker 5]
Oh, yeah, that, that part would be. Sorry.
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,090 [Speaker 3]
So what's the point of the pedestrian b-
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,090 [Speaker 3]
push buttons then?
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,390 [Speaker 5]
So I'm, I'm, I'm not an expert in this, so
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,320 [Speaker 5]
I'll just do the best that I can, and,
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,660 [Speaker 5]
well, maybe I shouldn't. I don't even
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,350 [Speaker 5]
know. Um, in talking with, uh, our traffic
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:56,100 [Speaker 5]
engineering team, it's that, um... I, um,
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,430 [Speaker 5]
maybe I'm confused about the question,
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:58,360 [Speaker 5]
honestly.
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,230 [Speaker 3]
So in the, in the study, in the staff
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,010 [Speaker 3]
report, it says that some pedestrian- some
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,710 [Speaker 3]
intersections
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,810 [Speaker 3]
will have pedestrian push buttons, beg
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,730 [Speaker 3]
buttons, uh, to initiate an audible noise.
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,190 [Speaker 3]
But, um, we heard earlier that, uh, there
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,720 [Speaker 3]
will be pedestrian recall on a lot of
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,750 [Speaker 3]
intersections, and so the point of having
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,910 [Speaker 3]
the, the beg buttons, the pedestrian push
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,370 [Speaker 3]
buttons, was so that an audible noise
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,970 [Speaker 3]
would be available.
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,530 [Speaker 5]
So, yeah. So, um,
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,410 [Speaker 5]
so I think the... A- and again, I, I think
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,940 [Speaker 5]
it's more about, like, we're having
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,510 [Speaker 5]
technology now that we'll be able to
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,020 [Speaker 5]
implement a more nuanced approach to this,
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,640 [Speaker 5]
and so but I think, like, scenarios that
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,730 [Speaker 5]
could arise is that, um, if somebody, uh,
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,070 [Speaker 5]
like, let's say it's late at night at, uh,
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:46,470 [Speaker 5]
Berkeley or something,
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:49,350 [Speaker 5]
and if it's coordinated to always do that
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,610 [Speaker 5]
automatically, regardless of time and
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,710 [Speaker 5]
traffic, let's say somebody walks by it
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:56,670 [Speaker 5]
but isn't intending to cross, and they
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,130 [Speaker 5]
trigger the sensor, and they switch the
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,990 [Speaker 5]
light. And then a tra- uh-
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,880 [Speaker 0]
somebody waiting in their car gets the
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,680 [Speaker 0]
light. And so there is, th- there can be
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,900 [Speaker 0]
this pattern where people that, again, we
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,140 [Speaker 0]
know that people break the law, so people
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,220 [Speaker 0]
s- can start to get frustrated, or they
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,740 [Speaker 0]
just run a red light if they're in their
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,620 [Speaker 0]
car, and they say, "Well,
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,930 [Speaker 0]
I don't see anybody. Like, why is this
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760 [Speaker 0]
light always triggered?" So I think that
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800 [Speaker 0]
the consideration is, is that there are
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,340 [Speaker 0]
scenarios, and there are certain times of
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,540 [Speaker 0]
day at certain locations where maybe we
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,560 [Speaker 0]
can use the technology to make it work in
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,680 [Speaker 0]
a more nuanced way, um, instead of just,
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,390 [Speaker 0]
you know, blanketing it, that it's always
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,280 [Speaker 0]
working this one way all the time. I think
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,619 [Speaker 0]
we can
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,500 [Speaker 0]
be nuanced about how we implement it, so
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,580 [Speaker 0]
that it's most effective at the right
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,400 [Speaker 0]
times for the most amount of people.
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,629 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Not sure I agree with that-
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:42,670 [Speaker 0]
Not sure if that answers your question.
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,790 [Speaker 1]
But
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,769 [Speaker 1]
I'll, I'll buy that for a dollar. Um,
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,820 [Speaker 1]
you mentioned... T-t-t-t- tch.
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,780 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, uh, so again, sorry, on the push
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,040 [Speaker 1]
buttons, you mentioned that part of what
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,960 [Speaker 1]
we're using here is data around which
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,240 [Speaker 1]
intersections have the most pedestrian
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,160 [Speaker 1]
crossings and at certain times, right? Um,
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,740 [Speaker 1]
did we control for anything around, maybe
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,160 [Speaker 1]
people aren't using these intersections
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,340 [Speaker 1]
because they're not safe?
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,590 [Speaker 0]
No, and, and, and we haven't
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,640 [Speaker 0]
done that analysis and assigned those
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,420 [Speaker 0]
locations. I mean, I think as we roll that
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,120 [Speaker 0]
out, that's the sort of thing we would,
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,750 [Speaker 0]
uh, look at, you know, volumes of
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,280 [Speaker 0]
pedestrians and things like that.
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,580 [Speaker 1]
Okay.
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,680 [Speaker 1]
Are there any specific treatments that can
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,040 [Speaker 1]
be installed within the next six to
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,960 [Speaker 1]
twelve months?
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,120 [Speaker 0]
Um-
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,050 [Speaker 2]
Signals.
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,620 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, like, you know, signal stuff. Um,
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,180 [Speaker 0]
I'm trying to remember.
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,400 [Speaker 2]
Leading pedestrian intervals.
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,330 [Speaker 0]
Leading pedestrian in-intervals. Some of
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,850 [Speaker 0]
the bus stops that are far-sided, I think,
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,510 [Speaker 0]
you know, working with BBB, we already
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,520 [Speaker 0]
moved one of them at, at Berkeley. So
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,580 [Speaker 0]
those sorts of things, I think, could be
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,390 [Speaker 0]
done very quickly with little effort in
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,640 [Speaker 0]
terms of, like, designing and... But, you
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,330 [Speaker 0]
know, re-striping and creating a, a
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,410 [Speaker 0]
striping signing plan, uh, with, you know,
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,500 [Speaker 0]
even vertical elements, paint and post,
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,750 [Speaker 0]
uh, curb extensions, and thing- things
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,199 [Speaker 0]
like that, uh, you know, all that has to
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,169 [Speaker 0]
be designed. That can be on a much faster
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,580 [Speaker 0]
track because we can use, um, contracted
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,440 [Speaker 0]
support staff that we have on call, uh, to
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,160 [Speaker 0]
do that, and, you know, this timeline
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,020 [Speaker 0]
kind of emphasizes that. You know, our
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,640 [Speaker 0]
intent, if, if this is adopted, is to move
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,620 [Speaker 0]
as quickly as we can to try to get the
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,360 [Speaker 0]
phase one done before the Olympics, and
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,800 [Speaker 0]
ideally, um, a phase two funded and half
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,640 [Speaker 0]
designed, and so started after the
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,380 [Speaker 0]
Olympics, right? So that would be our, our
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,820 [Speaker 0]
goal in terms of timeline for
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,360 [Speaker 0]
implementation. Um, and the only-- and
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,220 [Speaker 0]
but, you know, obviously, factors can slow
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,220 [Speaker 0]
that down. So...
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Were any raised treatments explored,
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,940 [Speaker 1]
specifically at Chelsea?
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,120 [Speaker 2]
Can you elaborate, raised treatments?
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,100 [Speaker 1]
Like a raised, like a raised crosswalk.
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,180 [Speaker 2]
A raised crosswalk. Um, they were not
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,049 [Speaker 2]
explored, um, primarily because
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,290 [Speaker 2]
of it being a multi-lane arterial. Um,
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,880 [Speaker 2]
it's not a treatment that we've
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,980 [Speaker 2]
done here in Santa Monica, nor one that
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,140 [Speaker 2]
I've seen on a multi-lane arterial that
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,580 [Speaker 2]
carries, you know, buses, um, first
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,230 [Speaker 2]
responders, and things that would have
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,470 [Speaker 2]
sort of vertical deflection. So it wasn't,
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,120 [Speaker 2]
uh, considered for the Chelsea
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,080 [Speaker 2]
intersection. Instead, we opted for the
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,620 [Speaker 2]
refuge island.
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,520 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Uh, last question: so we have a new
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,000 [Speaker 1]
city policy regarding, like,
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,420 [Speaker 1]
unidirectional or perpendicular curb cuts.
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,280 [Speaker 1]
Um, I saw some of the designs. I think
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,560 [Speaker 1]
the Sixth Street intersection on the Tar
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,600 [Speaker 1]
and Roses corner had that diagonal ramp. I
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,940 [Speaker 1]
assume that's just a,
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:42,910 [Speaker 1]
uh,
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,640 [Speaker 1]
an outdated design that if it's
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400 [Speaker 1]
technically feasible, we will do, um, city
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,780 [Speaker 1]
policy.
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,540 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. So at all the locations, we wanna
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,620 [Speaker 2]
ensure that curb ramps are aligned with
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,750 [Speaker 2]
the crosswalk. Um, at the Sixth Street
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,140 [Speaker 2]
location, for example, if we're proposing
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,580 [Speaker 2]
a new
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,600 [Speaker 2]
scramble crosswalk, a lot of those ramps
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,810 [Speaker 2]
in, um, in some cases, those ramps, um,
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,360 [Speaker 2]
are sort of at the corner, and they have
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,660 [Speaker 2]
sort of a wider radius or radii that would
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360 [Speaker 2]
allow for diagonal crossing as well as-
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,340 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, but Fourth Street.
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,380 [Speaker 2]
Correct. So at some locations, we may not
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,709 [Speaker 2]
want to necessarily direct traffic or
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,339 [Speaker 2]
pedestrian traffic in one direction, if
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,079 [Speaker 2]
that makes sense.
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,480 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, thank you.
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,650 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Raskin, then we have one
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120 [Speaker 3]
question from Council Member Zelic.
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,790 [Speaker 4]
Thanks, and I've, I've really just only
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,500 [Speaker 4]
got, I think, one question, uh, that was,
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,360 [Speaker 4]
uh, queued by, uh, Council Member
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,520 [Speaker 4]
Halison's questioning. Um, but first, just
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,780 [Speaker 4]
to clarify, when you're talking about
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,880 [Speaker 4]
the, the signal stuff we can do the next
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,710 [Speaker 4]
six to twelve months, are you talking
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,030 [Speaker 4]
about, like, signal coordination or things
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060 [Speaker 4]
along those lines?
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,800 [Speaker 2]
Signal coordination, um, of course,
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,810 [Speaker 2]
pending, you know, updating hardware,
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,300 [Speaker 2]
software, things of that nature, but
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,860 [Speaker 2]
essentially coordinating, um, the corridor
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,660 [Speaker 2]
so that it, you know, behaves in sort of
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,270 [Speaker 2]
a way we, we... or improves safety, or
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440 [Speaker 2]
speeds, or controls for congestion, things
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,680 [Speaker 2]
of that nature. Um, and then, uh, leading
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,400 [Speaker 2]
pedestrian intervals as well, um, those
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,010 [Speaker 2]
are the sort of signal treatments that
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,820 [Speaker 2]
are within, you know, and we do in-house.
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,930 [Speaker 4]
Got it. And, uh, so, uh, following up on,
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,150 [Speaker 4]
on Council Member Hal's question about,
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,030 [Speaker 4]
uh, speed limits and speed studies, um,
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,300 [Speaker 4]
and I've-- Paul, I was trying to ask this
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000 [Speaker 4]
in advance, but a member of the public had
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,160 [Speaker 4]
asked me, you know, I, I assume that
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,780 [Speaker 4]
signal prioritization for buses can be
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,200 [Speaker 4]
coordinated with the, uh, signal timing,
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,780 [Speaker 4]
uh, to mitigate speeds for, uh, vehicular
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600 [Speaker 4]
traffic. Um, can you just briefly speak to
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600 [Speaker 4]
how... Just confirm if that's, that's
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,020 [Speaker 4]
correct, essentially?
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,660 [Speaker 2]
Uh, are you referring to coordinating
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,240 [Speaker 2]
signals so that buses travel at consistent
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,280 [Speaker 2]
speeds? Is that-
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,490 [Speaker 4]
Exactly.
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,840 [Speaker 2]
- essentially? Yeah, and, and I think, you
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,130 [Speaker 2]
know, the, the through line here is that,
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080 [Speaker 2]
you know, buses are operating with, with
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,258 [Speaker 2]
vehicles and, you know, ensuring that-...
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,708 [Speaker 2]
speeds, especially during peak hours, are
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:08,728 [Speaker 2]
as free-flowing in the congested areas,
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,268 [Speaker 2]
um, helps drivers get in and out of Santa
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,988 [Speaker 2]
Monica, as well as transit patrons in and
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,808 [Speaker 2]
out of Santa Monica.
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:19,608 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Zuk?
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,948 [Speaker 6]
Sorry, just one question, um, that came up
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,498 [Speaker 6]
when we were talking about the, uh, uh,
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,368 [Speaker 6]
parallel study occurring around the bus
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,098 [Speaker 6]
lanes, uh, through the Westside COG. In
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,468 [Speaker 6]
the parts of the
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,588 [Speaker 6]
proposed designs that, that, that indicate
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,888 [Speaker 6]
a, uh, a bulb-out where the bus would
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:45,788 [Speaker 6]
then stop in lane, uh, in order to pick up
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:48,708 [Speaker 6]
passengers, i- isn't there some... Is
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:51,148 [Speaker 6]
there not a concern that building that,
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,408 [Speaker 6]
that treatment would actually potentially
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:53,867 [Speaker 6]
limit
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,988 [Speaker 6]
a bus-only lane if that were to be built
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,848 [Speaker 6]
in that section, seeing as then that
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,908 [Speaker 6]
parking lane could not easily become a bus
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,388 [Speaker 6]
lane if it was hardened with such a
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:05,088 [Speaker 6]
treatment?
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:09,628 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. The, the profile of the street west
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,088 [Speaker 2]
of Princeton is, it sort of starts
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:15,348 [Speaker 2]
narrowing every few blocks to a point
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:18,328 [Speaker 2]
where, um, even the parking lane being at
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:19,728 [Speaker 2]
seven feet-- Let's say, pick an
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:23,148 [Speaker 2]
intersection between 17th and 18th Street.
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:25,628 [Speaker 2]
Um, you have parking on both sides, and
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,488 [Speaker 2]
that parking lane is around seven feet,
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,088 [Speaker 2]
and those driving lanes are, let's say,
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:34,968 [Speaker 2]
anywhere between eleven and maybe, I don't
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,028 [Speaker 2]
know, around eleven feet. That parking
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:41,208 [Speaker 2]
lane is still insufficient for buses to
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:42,678 [Speaker 2]
travel there as, like, a peak hour
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,068 [Speaker 2]
bus-only lane, and there's not enough room
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,208 [Speaker 2]
in the travel lanes to squeeze them to
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:50,548 [Speaker 2]
widen that curbside lane. So in that
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:52,868 [Speaker 2]
instance, that number two lane would serve
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:55,468 [Speaker 2]
as a bus-only lane.
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,188 [Speaker 6]
Got it. Thank you.
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,568 [Speaker 5]
Okay, I have some questions that I haven't
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:02,188 [Speaker 5]
had the opportunity to go. Um,
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:04,268 [Speaker 5]
I appreciate all of your hard work on
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,748 [Speaker 5]
this, and I, I came to some of the
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:07,098 [Speaker 5]
community engagement. Really just
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,938 [Speaker 5]
appreciate how, how much you've done. Um,
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,228 [Speaker 5]
but I'm a little bit concerned just in
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:13,548 [Speaker 5]
terms of, like, what the governing
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:15,218 [Speaker 5]
principle is here, because I think this
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:18,708 [Speaker 5]
council has, um, kind of stated pretty
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,868 [Speaker 5]
emphatically our commitment to safety and
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:23,208 [Speaker 5]
Vision Zero. So can you just explain, is
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:25,068 [Speaker 5]
safety the governing principle here in
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,757 [Speaker 5]
everything that you've put forward, or is
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:30,348 [Speaker 5]
it level of service? And where did we make
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:32,868 [Speaker 5]
sacrifices based off of level of service
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,488 [Speaker 5]
in what we're seeing here?
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,398 [Speaker 2]
Safety is the number one approach for this
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:40,738 [Speaker 2]
project. Level of service was used as a
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,477 [Speaker 2]
tool to understand vehicle throughput and
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:46,568 [Speaker 2]
how the corridor functions without
00:08:46,588 --> 00:08:47,688 [Speaker 2]
improvements, but also
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:51,388 [Speaker 2]
with improvements. And I alluded to one
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,868 [Speaker 2]
location where, o- on 20th Street, where
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,768 [Speaker 2]
we had initially, you know, thought of the
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,928 [Speaker 2]
idea of a diagonal crossing there, a
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,128 [Speaker 2]
scramble crossing, and then walked that
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:02,668 [Speaker 2]
back and instead favoured protected left
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:06,308 [Speaker 2]
turns because the, um, the level of
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:07,878 [Speaker 2]
service at that location would
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,488 [Speaker 2]
make it so that people might have to wait
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:12,958 [Speaker 2]
two or three signal cycles in front of,
00:09:12,988 --> 00:09:14,548 [Speaker 2]
you know, Providence St. John's to get
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,528 [Speaker 2]
westbound past 20th Street. So that was-
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,288 [Speaker 5]
Sorry, when you say people, you mean cars,
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:19,768 [Speaker 5]
correct?
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,347 [Speaker 2]
Drivers, yeah. Um, so that was one
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,878 [Speaker 2]
location where we have sort of have to--
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,648 [Speaker 2]
had to balance the needs, but also improve
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,438 [Speaker 2]
that location with, you know, signal i--
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:34,208 [Speaker 2]
or left turn signals. Um, there are... If,
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:35,968 [Speaker 2]
if you-- like, if I can remember
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,488 [Speaker 2]
correctly, there's about eight other
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,628 [Speaker 2]
locations where level of service, in some
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:40,888 [Speaker 2]
cases,
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,868 [Speaker 2]
degrades a little bit in favour of the
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:46,608 [Speaker 2]
proposed improvements. So again, safety
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,108 [Speaker 2]
was the primary sort of driver for this
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:52,208 [Speaker 2]
project. Um, understanding that, you know,
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,808 [Speaker 2]
level of service and traffic and volume
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,308 [Speaker 2]
throughput
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,998 [Speaker 2]
may, uh, be impacted, in particular, let's
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:01,928 [Speaker 2]
say, the throughs and lefts from the side
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:04,338 [Speaker 2]
street locations where we're proposing,
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,068 [Speaker 2]
uh, several of these, uh,
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,008 [Speaker 2]
at the-- and signalised intersections. So
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:12,208 [Speaker 2]
that's one place where we are uplifting
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,568 [Speaker 2]
safety and the priority of pedestrians
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:17,188 [Speaker 2]
versus drivers being able to go through or
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:18,918 [Speaker 2]
make lefts at those side streets.
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,658 [Speaker 5]
It sounds like we made decisions here in
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,928 [Speaker 5]
this, what was presented to us, based off
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:28,008 [Speaker 5]
of level of service over s- pedestrian
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:30,328 [Speaker 5]
safety. And isn't it true that we've had
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:32,408 [Speaker 5]
over four hundred serious injury crashes
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,268 [Speaker 5]
in the last te- ten years here in the
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:34,948 [Speaker 5]
city?
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,078 [Speaker 5]
Like, wouldn't we wanna, on the street...
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,468 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, wouldn't we wanna prioritise
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,468 [Speaker 5]
safety? I, I mean, I understand that
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:42,598 [Speaker 5]
you're saying, okay, people are gonna have
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:43,938 [Speaker 5]
to wait a few cycles, but
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,248 [Speaker 5]
it sounds like we're prioritising the car
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,248 [Speaker 5]
experience over the pedestrian experience,
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:51,688 [Speaker 5]
if I'm not mistaken.
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,408 [Speaker 2]
I think that these recommendations do
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,648 [Speaker 2]
prioritise pedestrian safety and
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,738 [Speaker 2]
pedestrian crossings, um, and that's
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,428 [Speaker 2]
something we heard from the community.
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,258 [Speaker 2]
Again, a lot of the turn restrictions,
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:05,788 [Speaker 2]
medians, restricting left turns, those
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:06,688 [Speaker 2]
types of things do
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,108 [Speaker 2]
slightly de- degrade vehicle throughput.
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,988 [Speaker 2]
Um, people sort of making their route
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,608 [Speaker 2]
in the neighbourhood and through Santa
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:17,328 [Speaker 2]
Monica Boulevard, but that is a trade-off
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,538 [Speaker 2]
that I think, you know, this project does
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:23,088 [Speaker 2]
carry forward as something to, to do.
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:24,868 [Speaker 5]
Okay, um, I have to go back to this
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:29,828 [Speaker 5]
bus-only lanes. D- Why did we, um, limit
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,528 [Speaker 5]
the bus-only lanes to peak hours as
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,528 [Speaker 5]
opposed to all the time?
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:38,678 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, I think that the, um, recommendation
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:41,968 [Speaker 2]
here is in line with, um, the
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:45,798 [Speaker 2]
proposed peak hour bus-only lanes, um, in
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,408 [Speaker 2]
the city of LA portion, where we
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,728 [Speaker 2]
see, um, typically the most traffic during
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,768 [Speaker 2]
the peak hours. So we wanna provide the
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:54,288 [Speaker 2]
buses
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,388 [Speaker 2]
their own lane so that they're not
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:57,368 [Speaker 2]
competing with
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,728 [Speaker 2]
cars on the same street. So that's why
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,308 [Speaker 2]
peak hour bus-only lanes make sense. Um,
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:07,396 [Speaker 2]
during the rest of the time-... um, bus
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,476 [Speaker 2]
operations fairly steady. I believe we
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:11,736 [Speaker 2]
have around ten-minute headways outside of
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,855 [Speaker 2]
the peak hours, uh, so we wanna
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:16,206 [Speaker 2]
prioritize peak hour locations. Again,
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:19,396 [Speaker 2]
this is something we can- we do mostly
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,786 [Speaker 2]
with, you know, signage, enforcement, and
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,676 [Speaker 2]
striping. Um, what those peak hours look
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:25,016 [Speaker 2]
like
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,016 [Speaker 2]
can be determined, um,
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:31,076 [Speaker 2]
after we look at this, uh, Westside COG
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:32,736 [Speaker 2]
study a little bit more as well. We'll get
00:12:32,796 --> 00:12:35,036 [Speaker 2]
more information, but peak hours is the
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,496 [Speaker 2]
recommendation because of the traffic
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:36,946 [Speaker 2]
patterns.
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:39,856 [Speaker 5]
So basically,
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:43,496 [Speaker 5]
we're... our gold standard is the city of
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:46,236 [Speaker 5]
L.A. here?
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,756 [Speaker 2]
I failed to mention, um,
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:53,716 [Speaker 2]
loading zones and on-street parking for
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,616 [Speaker 2]
local businesses outside of the peak
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:57,456 [Speaker 2]
hours, that's something we can, again,
00:12:57,496 --> 00:13:00,376 [Speaker 2]
preserve, um, for local businesses.
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,045 [Speaker 5]
Okay, I mean, I don't think anyone here is
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,576 [Speaker 5]
saying that we don't wanna help our local
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,946 [Speaker 5]
businesses. I think that that's
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:05,856 [Speaker 5]
important, but
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,956 [Speaker 5]
seems like we're kind of, uh,
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:13,436 [Speaker 5]
I don't know, not prioritizing multimodal
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:14,896 [Speaker 5]
transit.
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,716 [Speaker 7]
Thank you, Mayor, for the question and for
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,266 [Speaker 7]
highlighting this. I think what you're
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,356 [Speaker 7]
hearing, a lot of the, the
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,266 [Speaker 7]
comments and the Q&A that we've heard from
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:24,056 [Speaker 7]
all of you, really highlights that all of
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,566 [Speaker 7]
this work is about trade-offs, right? And
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:26,546 [Speaker 7]
optimizing-
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:26,686 [Speaker 5]
Mm-hmm.
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:28,266 [Speaker 7]
- first and foremost, for safety, right?
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:28,306 [Speaker 5]
Yeah.
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,146 [Speaker 7]
And what Carlos has underscored is that
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,406 [Speaker 7]
this is a safety study.
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:31,736 [Speaker 5]
Right.
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:33,596 [Speaker 7]
The primary purpose, right, is to advance
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:35,136 [Speaker 7]
our Vision Zero objectives, and the
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:37,276 [Speaker 7]
council has, of course, clearly reiterated
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,436 [Speaker 7]
the primacy of that. Staff is fully
00:13:39,446 --> 00:13:41,336 [Speaker 7]
aligned with that. I think to your
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:42,716 [Speaker 7]
specific question with regards to the
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,296 [Speaker 7]
operation of peak hour bus lanes in the
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:47,726 [Speaker 7]
stretch that the study's putting forward,
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:50,876 [Speaker 7]
it really reflects when we actually get
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,556 [Speaker 7]
kind of the bang for our buck, so to
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,556 [Speaker 7]
speak, uh, with regard to current travel
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,236 [Speaker 7]
times. So overall, and we do have, um, you
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:58,446 [Speaker 7]
know, the, the lead of our transit
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,756 [Speaker 7]
planning performance here, if we really
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,876 [Speaker 7]
wanna nerd out on bus travel times, but
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,416 [Speaker 7]
overall, where we actually see the gains,
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,386 [Speaker 7]
where the buses are moving slower now,
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:07,936 [Speaker 7]
where they sort of need or really benefit
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,936 [Speaker 7]
the most from a bus-only lane, are those
00:14:09,956 --> 00:14:10,716 [Speaker 7]
peak hours-
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:10,726 [Speaker 5]
Okay
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,696 [Speaker 7]
... in both directions. The rest of the
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:15,366 [Speaker 7]
time, generally, um, Route 1 moves quite
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,386 [Speaker 7]
well. The metro buses move quite well, and
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,536 [Speaker 7]
so, yes, we would have to take away a
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,436 [Speaker 7]
significant amount of parking around the
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:23,316 [Speaker 7]
clock to have a twenty-four-hour bus-only
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,376 [Speaker 7]
lane. That's an option, but would we be
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:27,246 [Speaker 7]
actually getting the necessary benefit to
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,536 [Speaker 7]
our bus speed travel times in order to
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,956 [Speaker 7]
have a significant, potentially detriment
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,196 [Speaker 7]
to those businesses and those other uses?
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:35,636 [Speaker 7]
That's where those- that trade-off
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:36,785 [Speaker 7]
question, we really look at that
00:14:36,816 --> 00:14:39,196 [Speaker 7]
cost-benefit analysis. So that's similar
00:14:39,396 --> 00:14:41,196 [Speaker 7]
to how our existing, very successful lanes
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:43,036 [Speaker 7]
on Lincoln work. Those are actually
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,216 [Speaker 7]
currently one direction
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:47,096 [Speaker 7]
in peak hour. What we're proposing here is
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:49,196 [Speaker 7]
actually peak hour both directions, so
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,196 [Speaker 7]
that they would be bus-only lanes,
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:53,906 [Speaker 7]
eastbound and westbound, morning rush and
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,536 [Speaker 7]
afternoon rush. So actually, kind of, uh,
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:58,196 [Speaker 7]
an upgrade in some ways, uh, from the
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,796 [Speaker 7]
Lincoln bus-only lanes, which are
00:14:59,836 --> 00:15:01,736 [Speaker 7]
currently one direction in the morning and
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,096 [Speaker 7]
one direction in the evenings.
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:03,906 [Speaker 5]
Okay, I hear you.
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:03,906 [Speaker 7]
Yeah.
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,065 [Speaker 5]
That- thank you. I appreciate that kind
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:06,266 [Speaker 5]
of, uh-
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,316 [Speaker 7]
Just wanted to kind of clarify that.
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:07,836 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, yeah. That-
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:07,866 [Speaker 7]
Um-
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,696 [Speaker 5]
I appreciate that. Thank you. Um,
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:12,156 [Speaker 5]
so I have to bring up this McKinley
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,656 [Speaker 5]
Elementary issue again, um, because I
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,166 [Speaker 5]
don't know if I've made the point- we've
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:19,316 [Speaker 5]
made the point clear enough. Why are the
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,966 [Speaker 5]
pedestrian signal and raised median at
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,656 [Speaker 5]
Chelsea classified as Phase 2 rather than
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:23,836 [Speaker 5]
Phase 1?
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:27,116 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, really the Phase 2 des- designation
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:29,776 [Speaker 2]
is around the funding and the level of
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:32,476 [Speaker 2]
effort to construct the pedestrian signal
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:35,176 [Speaker 2]
curb ramps that align with the new
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:37,776 [Speaker 2]
crosswalk- the new crosswalk, and then a
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:40,666 [Speaker 2]
concrete median refuge island there. All
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:43,896 [Speaker 2]
those things require significant funding,
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,106 [Speaker 2]
design, um, engineering, and construction.
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:49,785 [Speaker 2]
So for those reasons, we couched it into
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,476 [Speaker 2]
a Phase 2, because it's advantageous, um,
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:56,005 [Speaker 2]
according to the Phase 2 ATP application
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:58,316 [Speaker 2]
and pr- getting the funding for that. Um,
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:00,396 [Speaker 2]
it could well be within, you know,
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:04,755 [Speaker 2]
the purview of the city to, um, make that
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,336 [Speaker 2]
a even higher priority. Uh, I think
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,126 [Speaker 2]
funding would be really the question
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:09,966 [Speaker 2]
behind that.
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,466 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, I mean, I think the issue is, is
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:13,476 [Speaker 5]
that what I'm hearing is like, "Well, we
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,636 [Speaker 5]
only have a limited amount of money, so
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:16,996 [Speaker 5]
we're gonna do, like, the low-hanging
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,156 [Speaker 5]
fruit first," rather than what is the
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:21,866 [Speaker 5]
biggest impact around safety. I mean, I'm
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,415 [Speaker 5]
just- I'm giving you feedback. That's the
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:25,576 [Speaker 5]
f- that's the vibe that I'm getting from
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:26,836 [Speaker 5]
the answers to these questions, and I
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:28,986 [Speaker 5]
think what you're hearing from us, is that
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:31,876 [Speaker 5]
we need to prioritize safety. So I guess
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,416 [Speaker 5]
it would be helpful to know if you could
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,546 [Speaker 5]
come back to us and say, um, "If we had
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,576 [Speaker 5]
XYZ amount of money for Phase 1,
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:41,836 [Speaker 5]
um, uh, we would be able to prioritize
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,336 [Speaker 5]
this, uh, intervention right now." Like,
00:16:44,396 --> 00:16:45,576 [Speaker 5]
is it an issue that you don't have enough
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,156 [Speaker 5]
money to do this?
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,616 [Speaker 8]
Madam Mayor, I might, um, um, offer a
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,636 [Speaker 8]
suggestion, too. I think some of this was
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,986 [Speaker 8]
designed with existing, um, sort of
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,196 [Speaker 8]
resources available. If that is a priority
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:57,756 [Speaker 8]
of the council this evening, that's one
00:16:57,796 --> 00:16:59,436 [Speaker 8]
of the pieces of feedback we're looking
00:16:59,496 --> 00:16:59,856 [Speaker 8]
for-
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:00,256 [Speaker 5]
Okay
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,786 [Speaker 8]
... to identify a prioritization, and if,
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,896 [Speaker 8]
um, that is the council's priority to look
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:06,996 [Speaker 8]
at Santa Monica, Chelsea, we'll
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:08,856 [Speaker 8]
definitely take that into account as we
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:11,176 [Speaker 8]
develop our capital budget moving into-
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:11,396 [Speaker 5]
Okay
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,546 [Speaker 8]
... um, the, um, the early spring and then
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,136 [Speaker 8]
the summer.
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:16,406 [Speaker 5]
'Cause it sounds like, okay, we can only
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,116 [Speaker 5]
do things with striping and bollards, but
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:20,136 [Speaker 5]
maybe some of these interventions require
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,336 [Speaker 5]
more than that, and we need to kind of
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:25,356 [Speaker 5]
assess whether... You know, what's, what,
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:26,416 [Speaker 5]
what is the biggest bang for our buck
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:27,396 [Speaker 5]
truly in Phase 1?
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:31,176 [Speaker 5]
Um, okay, uh, and then I, I, I obviously
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:32,856 [Speaker 5]
sent these questions in advance, but I'm
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,256 [Speaker 5]
h- I'm, I'm saying it here publicly
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,456 [Speaker 5]
because I think these things are important
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:36,796 [Speaker 5]
to me and the folks that are listening.
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:39,806 [Speaker 5]
But on the performance outcomes, I'm a
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,776 [Speaker 5]
little bit concerned that the only, like,
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:44,676 [Speaker 5]
key safety indicator or key performance
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,916 [Speaker 5]
indicator is, like, less pedestrian
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:49,986 [Speaker 5]
deaths or injuries. And I think I would
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:53,056 [Speaker 5]
like to be able to see, uh... I mean,
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:55,316 [Speaker 5]
could you come back to us with additional
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,966 [Speaker 5]
KSIs or KPIs around speed reduction, um,
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,796 [Speaker 5]
pedestrian delay, bus on-time performance,
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,776 [Speaker 5]
et cetera? Like, I, I think we need some
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:06,126 [Speaker 5]
more robust me- measures through which to,
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:06,576 [Speaker 5]
um-
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,740 [Speaker 3]
... evaluate whether this is working.
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,460 [Speaker 3]
Would you say that that's fair?
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,520 [Speaker 2]
Absolutely, and we, we are prepared to
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,840 [Speaker 2]
sort of look at, you know, we did our
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,960 [Speaker 2]
existing conditions analysis for bus
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,660 [Speaker 2]
ridership, speeds. Obviously, we have
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280 [Speaker 2]
crash history, um, and we've actually been
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000 [Speaker 2]
looking at a counts plus methodology that,
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,620 [Speaker 2]
um, Caltrans has sort of, uh, uh,
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,340 [Speaker 2]
developed as through the ATP project. So
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,140 [Speaker 2]
if, uh, we apply and get that grant, we'd
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,700 [Speaker 2]
be, um, applying that for yield compliance
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,830 [Speaker 2]
in particular. So that's another, uh,
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,010 [Speaker 2]
metric that we'd be able to assess, uh,
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,390 [Speaker 2]
before and after for yield compliance, in
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,909 [Speaker 2]
addition to all the other metrics that I
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,830 [Speaker 2]
had mentioned.
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,640 [Speaker 3]
Okay, great. And I see a question from
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,620 [Speaker 3]
Councilmember Hall, but I think we're
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,660 [Speaker 3]
ready to move into... No? Comments. Okay,
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,720 [Speaker 3]
great. Councilmember Hall. Thank you.
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,300 [Speaker 3]
What?
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,160 [Speaker 1]
It's a public hearing, right?
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,540 [Speaker 3]
No.
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,570 [Speaker 1]
No?
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880 [Speaker 3]
No, the only thing that's a public hearing
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,880 [Speaker 3]
is 12A.
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:57,909 [Speaker 1]
Oh.
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,340 [Speaker 3]
12B, sorry. Yeah.
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,860 [Speaker 1]
My bad.
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,120 [Speaker 3]
No, it's fine. Continue.
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,440 [Speaker 1]
All good. Uh, thank you, Mayor. Um,
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,060 [Speaker 1]
so I used to live two buildings away from
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,600 [Speaker 1]
the intersection of Santa Monica and Yale,
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,840 [Speaker 1]
uh, and one day I was working in my home
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,720 [Speaker 1]
office when I heard a crash so violent
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,460 [Speaker 1]
that the
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,580 [Speaker 1]
window to my office shook. Um, a driver
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,080 [Speaker 1]
had been speeding westbound on Santa
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,840 [Speaker 1]
Monica, lost control, ran the red at Yale,
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,460 [Speaker 1]
and hit a palm tree with such force that
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,480 [Speaker 1]
she wiped the t- entire tree out
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,980 [Speaker 1]
and continued on with enough force to
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,820 [Speaker 1]
smash into our bus stop there, um, which
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,820 [Speaker 1]
was, like, fifteen feet further from the
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,640 [Speaker 1]
tree. So I, I ran outside to help. I
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,300 [Speaker 1]
opened the driver door. The driver kind
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,180 [Speaker 1]
of, like, stumbled out in a daze. Um, the
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,900 [Speaker 1]
car, I'm sure, was totaled. Uh, and, like,
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,860 [Speaker 1]
she is lucky that she is alive. And, and
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,840 [Speaker 1]
frankly, we as a community are extremely
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,900 [Speaker 1]
lucky that she hit that tree, because if
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,000 [Speaker 1]
she had been five feet to the left or five
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,180 [Speaker 1]
feet to the right, she would've careened
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,720 [Speaker 1]
into a building that's filled with
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,720 [Speaker 1]
children's dentistry offices. Um,
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,520 [Speaker 1]
and, and of course, who can forget the
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,940 [Speaker 1]
more recent crash, uh, that affected the
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,060 [Speaker 1]
Serce Speedy print shop? So, like, these
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,180 [Speaker 1]
are not fluke accidents, and we should
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,260 [Speaker 1]
expect this to happen when speed meets
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,560 [Speaker 1]
forgiving engineering. Um,
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,920 [Speaker 1]
I really wanna thank y'all for the work
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,360 [Speaker 1]
that you've done on this. Uh, you know,
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600 [Speaker 1]
the crash analysis was really
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,409 [Speaker 1]
comprehensive. The public engagement was
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,220 [Speaker 1]
very thoughtful. Um, I really appreciate
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,920 [Speaker 1]
that you listened to neighbors who had key
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,580 [Speaker 1]
criticisms of the current road conditions
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,480 [Speaker 1]
and specific intersections, and I
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,500 [Speaker 1]
appreciate that many of the ideas that we
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,290 [Speaker 1]
discussed in the first study session, um,
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,300 [Speaker 1]
are reflected, including the new medians,
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,120 [Speaker 1]
the landscaping, uh, the crosswalks, the
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,640 [Speaker 1]
lighting, the curb bulb outs. Um, it's
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,950 [Speaker 1]
really clear that you listened to much of
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,409 [Speaker 1]
this, and, and I'm really grateful for
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,240 [Speaker 1]
that. Uh, but I have to say, if I'm being
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,800 [Speaker 1]
completely honest, it does feel a little
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,320 [Speaker 1]
bit like Groundhog Day up here. Um, we've
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,760 [Speaker 1]
now had the same conversation about
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,160 [Speaker 1]
parking spots and far side bus lanes and
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,770 [Speaker 1]
bus stops, like, multiple times now with
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,469 [Speaker 1]
the East Pico Boulevard Safety Project,
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,860 [Speaker 1]
with the first iteration of the safety
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,420 [Speaker 1]
study last summer. And as our DOT director
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,500 [Speaker 1]
mentioned, like, this is about
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,620 [Speaker 1]
trade-offs. Um, and you mentioned that
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,220 [Speaker 1]
you're aligned with our thoughts on Vision
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,080 [Speaker 1]
Zero, but then we're also hearing that,
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,620 [Speaker 1]
you know, you got pushback on certain
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960 [Speaker 1]
safety, uh, initiatives and safety
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,660 [Speaker 1]
designs, you know, quote, "from the
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,370 [Speaker 1]
community." And while I s- stand by, like,
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,080 [Speaker 1]
I appreciate your consultation with the
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,580 [Speaker 1]
community,
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,000 [Speaker 1]
but that sounds like you're making design
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,120 [Speaker 1]
choices contrary to policies set by the
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,620 [Speaker 1]
council. Um, so, like, let us be your
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200 [Speaker 1]
shield against people who don't want to
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,000 [Speaker 1]
see these improvements. If the voters
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,580 [Speaker 1]
don't like what we're doing here, they
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,800 [Speaker 1]
will vote us out of office. But four of us
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320 [Speaker 1]
were elected in the last election, and
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,260 [Speaker 1]
won pretty handedly on a policy platform
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,440 [Speaker 1]
that promised a zealous approach to street
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,980 [Speaker 1]
safety and always prioritizing safety
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,930 [Speaker 1]
over parking or level of service or
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,660 [Speaker 1]
vehicular speed. You know, this corridor,
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,380 [Speaker 1]
this, this street has had four hundred and
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,960 [Speaker 1]
thirty-five high-injury crashes in ten
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,400 [Speaker 1]
years. Pedestrians and vulnerable users
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,740 [Speaker 1]
are over-represented in all those
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,720 [Speaker 1]
injuries, and, like, that's a speed
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,150 [Speaker 1]
problem. And as we heard tonight, you
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,880 [Speaker 1]
know, we didn't even do any reductions in
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,940 [Speaker 1]
speed limits on Santa Monica during the
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,950 [Speaker 1]
last speed study. So I guess, like, I
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,400 [Speaker 1]
would say, and, like, quite emphatically
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,300 [Speaker 1]
say, underlined, bold, italicized: if an
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,130 [Speaker 1]
improvement reduces the likelihood of
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,469 [Speaker 1]
someone being killed or se-re-
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,870 [Speaker 1]
reduces the likelihood... Sorry, I'll
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,420 [Speaker 1]
start over. If an improvement reduces the
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,580 [Speaker 1]
likelihood of someone being killed or
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,520 [Speaker 1]
seriously injured, but reduces vehicle
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,680 [Speaker 1]
throughput, like, we support that
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,980 [Speaker 1]
improvement. And I'd ask my colleagues
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,080 [Speaker 1]
that in our motion tonight, um, if we make
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,430 [Speaker 1]
one, we explicitly state that as part of
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,740 [Speaker 1]
what we, um... as part of it, so that as
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,280 [Speaker 1]
we move into project design of these
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400 [Speaker 1]
improvements, like, no safety cou-
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,750 [Speaker 1]
countermeasure will be eliminated because
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,810 [Speaker 1]
it worsens vehicular throughput. Um,
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,220 [Speaker 1]
so I, I appreciate this work, I really do,
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,320 [Speaker 1]
uh, but it feels contrary to some of
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,590 [Speaker 1]
the, the recent, uh, policy direction that
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,940 [Speaker 1]
we've given, um, especially at the last
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,650 [Speaker 1]
meeting, uh, with regards to Vision Zero.
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,150 [Speaker 1]
And, you know, like, when I asked about
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220 [Speaker 1]
why we're not moving a bus stop to the far
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,700 [Speaker 1]
side of Twenty-Six, we were told that it
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,160 [Speaker 1]
was because we wanna prioritize two
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,109 [Speaker 1]
parking spots, uh, for a business. And,
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,790 [Speaker 1]
like, that's a, that's a policy decision
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,120 [Speaker 1]
for ours- for us to make. And, like, as
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,560 [Speaker 1]
we've stated time and time again, we wanna
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,560 [Speaker 1]
prioritize the street safety and public
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,600 [Speaker 1]
transit over parking, public transit over
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,320 [Speaker 1]
private vehicles, and pedestrian and
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,900 [Speaker 1]
bicyclist safety over driver speed. Um,
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,780 [Speaker 1]
and so as, as a bit of a preview to the
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,720 [Speaker 1]
community for our upcoming police
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,790 [Speaker 1]
department annual report, you know, the
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,620 [Speaker 1]
police department are doing their, their,
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,000 [Speaker 1]
their fair share of, of street safety
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,600 [Speaker 1]
work. You know, they've stepped up traffic
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,140 [Speaker 1]
enforcement threefold since Chief Jacobs
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,820 [Speaker 1]
has taken over. Um,
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,010 [Speaker 1]
and I wanna make sure our, our DOT and
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,100 [Speaker 1]
public works teams
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,220 [Speaker 1]
are helping make PD's job easier by
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,520 [Speaker 1]
designing the best streets possible. Uh,
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:05,980 [Speaker 1]
so
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,800 [Speaker 1]
I will not be voting to approve this item
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,940 [Speaker 1]
tonight, and would love to see staff
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,780 [Speaker 1]
return in sixty days with more meaningful
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,820 [Speaker 1]
improvements, uh, that prioritize safety
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,120 [Speaker 1]
better. Thank you.
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,970 [Speaker 5]
... Um, Council Member Zwick, I'm also
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,470 [Speaker 5]
prepared to say something about what I
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,590 [Speaker 5]
think summarizes what most of us asked
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,710 [Speaker 5]
about.
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:28,950 [Speaker 6]
I'll be
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,980 [Speaker 6]
brief then, um, and just say that a-
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,710 [Speaker 6]
again, I, I appreciate the work that's
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,930 [Speaker 6]
gone to this study. I think there's a lot
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,710 [Speaker 6]
of good work. Uh, I'm excited, um, to see
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,930 [Speaker 6]
the right-turn restrictions, the
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,260 [Speaker 6]
improvements at Chelsea, uh, a number of
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,900 [Speaker 6]
things like that. Uh, I am concerned that
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,270 [Speaker 6]
we haven't done enough to reduce lane
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,580 [Speaker 6]
widths as per direction from council, um,
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,270 [Speaker 6]
that we haven't farsighted enough bus
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,420 [Speaker 6]
stops, you know, at intersections where it
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,410 [Speaker 6]
is feasible. Uh, that, um, we didn't look
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,880 [Speaker 6]
perhaps for more efficiencies for our
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,010 [Speaker 6]
bus, um, uh, bus at, at, at sections where
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,510 [Speaker 6]
we've identified where the bus speeds are
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,910 [Speaker 6]
very slow, uh, specifically eastbound in
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,670 [Speaker 6]
our downtown. Uh, and I would like to see
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,230 [Speaker 6]
an exploration of raised crossings at
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,340 [Speaker 6]
certain unsignalized intersections. Um,
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,870 [Speaker 6]
the Federal Highway Administration
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,350 [Speaker 6]
indicates that if it's at speeds below
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,850 [Speaker 6]
thirty miles an hour, it's an effective
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,510 [Speaker 6]
way of, um, slowing traffic speeds
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,710 [Speaker 6]
without, um, necessarily compromising, uh,
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,740 [Speaker 6]
buses or emergency responders if done
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,530 [Speaker 6]
appropriately. So those are just some
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,730 [Speaker 6]
thoughts of mine.
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,150 [Speaker 5]
Council Member Zarnetskaya.
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,010 [Speaker 9]
Thank you. And I agree with much of what's
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,610 [Speaker 9]
been said, and, um, I do also agree that
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:35,770 [Speaker 9]
I'm
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,630 [Speaker 9]
very grateful for all of the work that has
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,270 [Speaker 9]
gone into this. I recognize it's not an
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,750 [Speaker 9]
easy task to try to get feedback from the
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,490 [Speaker 9]
public and balance our council direction
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,450 [Speaker 9]
with the de- the demands of the people,
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,910 [Speaker 9]
with the demands of businesses, and
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,910 [Speaker 9]
everybody else that uses our streets. Um,
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,660 [Speaker 9]
I do agree about the prioritization of the
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,010 [Speaker 9]
intersection at Chelsea to make it safer
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,850 [Speaker 9]
for the kids at McKinley. I also agree
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,690 [Speaker 9]
about prioritizing pedestrian and cyclist
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,330 [Speaker 9]
safety, even if it reduces vehicular
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,410 [Speaker 9]
throughput, through- throughput, that's a
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,970 [Speaker 9]
difficult name-- word to say sometimes.
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,430 [Speaker 9]
Um, according to the staff report,
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,970 [Speaker 9]
pedestrians are over-represented in fatal
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,680 [Speaker 9]
and severe injury crashes. So, uh, that's
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,749 [Speaker 9]
part of why I think we really need
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,550 [Speaker 9]
to pri- prioritize pedestrian and cyclist
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,170 [Speaker 9]
safety, because as we know, when there is
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,410 [Speaker 9]
a pedestrian or cyclist versus vehicle,
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,850 [Speaker 9]
it's the people that are outside of that
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,430 [Speaker 9]
vehicle that are the most significantly
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,780 [Speaker 9]
injured or sometimes killed. Um, I
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,350 [Speaker 9]
noticed that in the staff report, there
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,080 [Speaker 9]
was a comment that not all incidents are
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,910 [Speaker 9]
preventable. So it said on, uh, "Notably,
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,770 [Speaker 9]
not all incidents are preventable from a
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,010 [Speaker 9]
roadway design and/or safety enhancement
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,990 [Speaker 9]
process." And I completely understand
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,270 [Speaker 9]
that. People are people. We are human.
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,850 [Speaker 9]
Everybody makes mistakes, everyone gets
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,950 [Speaker 9]
distracted at times, whether we're behind
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,110 [Speaker 9]
the wheel of a car, whether we're on a
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,050 [Speaker 9]
two-wheeled vehicle, maybe a unicycle. I
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,750 [Speaker 9]
don't know who rides a unicycle around
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,050 [Speaker 9]
here, or if you're walking. Um, but I did
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,950 [Speaker 9]
wanna note that I don't know if anyone's
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,670 [Speaker 9]
read There Are No Accidents by Jesse
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,710 [Speaker 9]
Singer. It's a really great book about how
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,430 [Speaker 9]
a lot of the things that... And y- just
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,530 [Speaker 9]
to backtrack a little bit, I really
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,670 [Speaker 9]
appreciate that we're using the language
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,310 [Speaker 9]
of collisions and crashes as opposed to
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,290 [Speaker 9]
accidents, because these aren't accidents.
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,850 [Speaker 9]
Yes, in-- not all incidents are
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,590 [Speaker 9]
preventable, but significant injury and
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,310 [Speaker 9]
deaths
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,790 [Speaker 9]
are preventable when we prioritize the
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,850 [Speaker 9]
appropriate infrastructure. And one
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,099 [Speaker 9]
of the things that, uh, was noted in the
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,550 [Speaker 9]
book was that we can make roadways safer
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,550 [Speaker 9]
by designing them with the, quote,
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,310 [Speaker 9]
unquote, "lowest common denominator user"
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,390 [Speaker 9]
in mind. So the person that is
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,030 [Speaker 9]
significantly distracted, the person who
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,090 [Speaker 9]
is trying to, uh, keep an eye on a million
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,590 [Speaker 9]
things going on all at once, to make sure
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:17,810 [Speaker 9]
that
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,530 [Speaker 9]
they don't get a chance to
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,190 [Speaker 9]
make an inadvertent mistake that can hurt
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,090 [Speaker 9]
or kill someone. Um, so I do wanna make
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,450 [Speaker 9]
sure that we're, we're prioritizing those
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,250 [Speaker 9]
things. Um, and I do also agree about
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,590 [Speaker 9]
exploring raised crossings at certain
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,170 [Speaker 9]
intersections. So if we're able to include
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,850 [Speaker 9]
all of this feedback and direction within
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,370 [Speaker 9]
the item,
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,959 [Speaker 9]
um, I'm happy to vote for it, but I
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,740 [Speaker 9]
do wanna hear where everyone else is at.
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,550 [Speaker 5]
Councilor Ruffing.
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,810 [Speaker 4]
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna start by echoing
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,750 [Speaker 4]
the thanks for the work that, uh, you and
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,140 [Speaker 4]
the team have put into this. Um, it's--
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,450 [Speaker 4]
it, it's not easy to
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,390 [Speaker 4]
embrace trade-offs in a complex way, and,
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,850 [Speaker 4]
uh, I think that we're certainly aware of,
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,730 [Speaker 4]
uh, the complexity with some of the work
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,030 [Speaker 4]
that goes into this. Uh, you know, ech-
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,690 [Speaker 4]
echoing what, uh, my colleagues have said,
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,690 [Speaker 4]
I, I, I am supportive of making sure that
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,330 [Speaker 4]
we, we get this right and taking the time
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:19,810 [Speaker 4]
that we need to explore all options. But,
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,330 [Speaker 4]
uh, for the sake of developing consensus
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,750 [Speaker 4]
up here, I, I think I speak for all of us
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,330 [Speaker 4]
when I say that I, I wouldn't want any
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,210 [Speaker 4]
delay to slow down anything that can be
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,500 [Speaker 4]
implemented now to improve safety. You
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,750 [Speaker 4]
know, quick build options, signalization
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,060 [Speaker 4]
improvement, or anything else that we can
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,870 [Speaker 4]
start now to kick off this work and to
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,430 [Speaker 4]
promote the goal of safety that I think we
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,970 [Speaker 4]
all want. So, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm also
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,930 [Speaker 4]
curious to hear where we're gonna land
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,480 [Speaker 4]
with a motion, if there is one, but, uh, I
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,750 [Speaker 4]
just wanna say that for the sake of
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,230 [Speaker 4]
developing consensus.
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,250 [Speaker 5]
Okay, well, I'll, I'll go, 'cause I think
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,450 [Speaker 5]
I actually heard, uh, some, some feedback
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,870 [Speaker 5]
on what folks thought up here w- was
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,750 [Speaker 5]
missing. Um, and I, I too-- I don't wanna
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,610 [Speaker 5]
say that any of these comments should be
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,790 [Speaker 5]
taken as anything less than appreciation.
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,290 [Speaker 5]
I just think we're kind of reacting to
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,290 [Speaker 5]
what we were given and, and I have to say,
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,320 [Speaker 5]
we can't be given this amount of
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,250 [Speaker 5]
voluminous staff report, like three or
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,830 [Speaker 5]
four days before the meeting. We have to
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,850 [Speaker 5]
have some sort of briefing, because this
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,610 [Speaker 5]
was, uh, a lot of information to digest
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,200 [Speaker 5]
with a very short period of time. So w-...
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,150 [Speaker 5]
uh, City Manager Qi, hopefully we can
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,880 [Speaker 5]
rectify that in the future. Um, but I
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,360 [Speaker 5]
think, you know, this is very serious,
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,670 [Speaker 5]
very thoughtful work that you all have
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,410 [Speaker 5]
done, um, very deliberatively, and I
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,750 [Speaker 5]
appreciate that you're trying to balance
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440 [Speaker 5]
the trade-offs. I do get that, and I'm not
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,829 [Speaker 5]
trying to be, um, ungrateful, but I do
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,070 [Speaker 5]
think that, you know, we've all said Santa
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,350 [Speaker 5]
Monica Boulevard has experienced over 400
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,430 [Speaker 5]
injury cra- crashes in the last decade,
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,130 [Speaker 5]
and this council has said pretty
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,630 [Speaker 5]
emphatically that we're committed to clean
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,410 [Speaker 5]
and safe. Well, safety means pedestrian
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,250 [Speaker 5]
and bicycle, um, safety as well, and
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,270 [Speaker 5]
we're, we're pretty seriously committed to
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,600 [Speaker 5]
that. Um, and I think that safety needs
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,050 [Speaker 5]
to take precedence in what we're seeing
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,630 [Speaker 5]
here, and I just, quite frankly, did not,
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,410 [Speaker 5]
um, totally feel that commitment in some
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,630 [Speaker 5]
of the trade-offs that were mentioned. I
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,870 [Speaker 5]
think that, uh, when safety improvements,
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,859 [Speaker 5]
uh, are, are in, in conflict with
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,990 [Speaker 5]
vehicular lev- level of service,
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:20,270 [Speaker 5]
we have to calibrate around safety, not
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,990 [Speaker 5]
level of service. Um, and we haven't
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,570 [Speaker 5]
really fully aligned with our Vision Zero
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,490 [Speaker 5]
policy, so that's where I'm coming from
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,590 [Speaker 5]
here. Um, I think I heard that... So I'm,
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,170 [Speaker 5]
I'm gonna propose something, and you guys
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,910 [Speaker 5]
let me know what you think. I do think
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,050 [Speaker 5]
that you all need to come back in, in two
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,630 [Speaker 5]
months here. Uh, I think that we need to
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,430 [Speaker 5]
see a reduction in lane widths to
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,310 [Speaker 5]
approximately ten feet on average, as
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,550 [Speaker 5]
directed by council. We've heard that the
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,850 [Speaker 5]
lane widths, wi- lane widths need to be
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,530 [Speaker 5]
reduced, specifically 20th Street to
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,650 [Speaker 5]
Chelsea, Chelsea Avenue to 26th Street,
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,350 [Speaker 5]
uh, were referenced as problems. Um, and I
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,720 [Speaker 5]
think we need to make all the bus stops
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,430 [Speaker 5]
far-sighted wherever feasible as a best
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,250 [Speaker 5]
practice, uh, which was also mentioned.
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,890 [Speaker 5]
Um, 26th and Santa Monica Boulevard
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,090 [Speaker 5]
i- in particular. Uh, we need to extend
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,090 [Speaker 5]
the bus-only lane east down in downtown
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,810 [Speaker 5]
from 4th Street to Lincoln. I think that
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,610 [Speaker 5]
was mentioned as a, a fe- a piece of
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,930 [Speaker 5]
feedback that w- was missing. Um, we need
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,490 [Speaker 5]
to explore raised
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,670 [Speaker 5]
crossings. I think there's some debate
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,250 [Speaker 5]
here on whether or not that works, but,
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,690 [Speaker 5]
uh, you know, we've, we've looked at it
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,990 [Speaker 5]
and, and seen feedback, and we need to
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,370 [Speaker 5]
explore raised crossings at, as, at new
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,290 [Speaker 5]
and existing unsignalized intersections.
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,650 [Speaker 5]
Um, and prioritize pedestrian signal and
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,650 [Speaker 5]
raised crossings at Chelsea as a phase one
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,690 [Speaker 5]
project. Uh, we, we all, I think, kind
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,390 [Speaker 5]
of, uh, talked about that. We wanna
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,330 [Speaker 5]
protect our kids who are in school, and if
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,530 [Speaker 5]
we need to allocate money from the
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,810 [Speaker 5]
capital improvement budget to do so, we
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,890 [Speaker 5]
are, um, I think, amenable to that and
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,599 [Speaker 5]
wanna hear staff's recommendation on what
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,510 [Speaker 5]
really would give us the best safety
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,430 [Speaker 5]
solution. Um, and prioritize
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,570 [Speaker 5]
safety over level of service and transit
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,110 [Speaker 5]
over parking, to just make that
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,410 [Speaker 5]
emphatically clear. Um, we also want
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,710 [Speaker 5]
feedback on what actually can be
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,210 [Speaker 5]
accomplished in the next six to twelve
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,530 [Speaker 5]
months, not two years. Uh, so it would be
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,970 [Speaker 5]
helpful to know, to Council Member
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,050 [Speaker 5]
Raskin's point, what are the things that
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,690 [Speaker 5]
we're getting done right away versus
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,150 [Speaker 5]
what's a little bit longer term, even in
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,360 [Speaker 5]
the phase one? Um, that was one of my
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,890 [Speaker 5]
questions, and I don't think I got a clear
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,270 [Speaker 5]
answer to it. I see you all are, um,
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,230 [Speaker 5]
conferring there. Um, and then I think we
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,210 [Speaker 5]
need to reevaluate everything in phase one
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,900 [Speaker 5]
for the highest impact interventions, and
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,070 [Speaker 5]
when we say impact, we mean safety. Um,
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,410 [Speaker 5]
and then we need to get feedback from, uh,
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,010 [Speaker 5]
City Manager Qi as to what we need from
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,350 [Speaker 5]
the capital improvement budget, and then
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,450 [Speaker 5]
we'll make the decision as to whether the
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,690 [Speaker 5]
trade-offs are, are needed based on the
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,450 [Speaker 5]
budget ask. And we wanna see some real
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,740 [Speaker 5]
KSIs that are gonna be tracked, uh, and
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,630 [Speaker 5]
reported out post-implementation. Uh, and
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,250 [Speaker 5]
then finally, I think you heard from
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,750 [Speaker 5]
Council Members Zernak Sky and others that
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,450 [Speaker 5]
we wanna pri- prioritize pedestrian
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,910 [Speaker 5]
recall over push buttons, uh, and so
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,210 [Speaker 5]
coming back with those recommendations.
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,510 [Speaker 5]
And so, um, I would say that I would make
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,170 [Speaker 5]
a motion that we, um, discuss this again
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,250 [Speaker 5]
in two months, uh, with that feedback
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,150 [Speaker 5]
incorporated.
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,370 [Speaker 1]
I'll second that.
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,490 [Speaker 5]
Is there any other discussion on that?
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,570 [Speaker 4]
Sorry, just to
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,890 [Speaker 4]
make sure we're on the same page. So I, I,
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,920 [Speaker 4]
I don't think this is the intent of what
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,490 [Speaker 4]
you're saying, but we're, we're not gonna
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,370 [Speaker 4]
slow down the work that's gonna be started
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,170 [Speaker 4]
now, today, between now and coming back
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,670 [Speaker 4]
in two months?
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,950 [Speaker 5]
Sure, but, um, City Manager Qi, are we
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,650 [Speaker 5]
slowing anything down by asking for this?
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,169 [Speaker 8]
The um... I- i- in essence, no, we can do
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:43,849 [Speaker 8]
both. The, um, feedback tonight's been
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,030 [Speaker 8]
clear. I think staff has an understanding
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,850 [Speaker 8]
what the council is intending. Um, what's
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,530 [Speaker 8]
presented before you, though, really
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,810 [Speaker 8]
ultimately constitutes concepts that we're
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,230 [Speaker 8]
thinking about. Um, it is not final
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,580 [Speaker 8]
design, per se. It's not the design of the
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,270 [Speaker 8]
street. It's not the design of the actual
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,270 [Speaker 8]
capital project-
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:00,300 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,990 [Speaker 8]
... that we're working on. And so if the
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,230 [Speaker 8]
direction is continue to mature concept
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,060 [Speaker 8]
plan, certainly it takes some time to do
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,160 [Speaker 8]
that. Um, we would like to concurrently
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,590 [Speaker 8]
move towards, um, all of the design work
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,610 [Speaker 8]
for implementing the actual project in
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,990 [Speaker 8]
'27, is when construction currently is
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,550 [Speaker 8]
internally slated to start, and so we do
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,770 [Speaker 8]
need to move towards design processes at
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:25,050 [Speaker 8]
some point. I think we've heard all of the
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,130 [Speaker 8]
feedback clearly. So if, um, what I might
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,880 [Speaker 8]
suggest, if the council would like us to
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,470 [Speaker 8]
maybe synthesize what we're hearing, bring
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,430 [Speaker 8]
it back to you, maybe even sooner than in
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,810 [Speaker 8]
sixty days, as it relates to design
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,530 [Speaker 8]
concepts you want implemented into the
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,210 [Speaker 8]
permanent design, we can compile those
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,930 [Speaker 8]
suggestions, bring it back, um, relatively
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,190 [Speaker 8]
quickly, and then if we have concurrence
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,910 [Speaker 8]
with the council, um, maybe move into
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,910 [Speaker 8]
actual design of what the capital project
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,430 [Speaker 8]
will look like.
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,830 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, I don't think anything here is
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,750 [Speaker 5]
intended to slow it down. My understanding
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,560 [Speaker 5]
is that today was just concepts, and that
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,760 [Speaker 5]
there wasn't anything ready to, like,
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,290 [Speaker 5]
we're not putting a, out a bollard
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,320 [Speaker 5]
tomorrow. Um, so yeah, that, that's, um, I
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,650 [Speaker 5]
think, um, synthesizes well what we're
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,930 [Speaker 5]
intending to do, and, uh, we have a, a
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,450 [Speaker 5]
motion and a second.
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,000 [Speaker 8]
The only thing that maybe I'd suggest, I
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,400 [Speaker 8]
think the motion was within sixty days,
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,370 [Speaker 8]
bring something back as it relates to
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,550 [Speaker 8]
updating the concepts. Would the council
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,590 [Speaker 8]
be amenable to maybe considering that the
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,170 [Speaker 8]
direction is synthesize the feedback we've
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,420 [Speaker 8]
received tonight, and identify more
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,990 [Speaker 8]
clearly for the council the specific
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,570 [Speaker 8]
improvements we've heard that we would
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,070 [Speaker 8]
integrate into a permanent design? Um, we
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,530 [Speaker 8]
could probably get that done a lot more
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,770 [Speaker 8]
quickly than in sixty days and would
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,190 [Speaker 8]
likely allow us to transition maybe into
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,250 [Speaker 8]
something a little bit more, um,
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,990 [Speaker 8]
substantive as it relates to the actual
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,830 [Speaker 8]
design work.
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,470 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, I would say, um, in no more than
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,890 [Speaker 5]
sixty days. So if you wanna bring it back
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,810 [Speaker 5]
sooner, that's great. Council Member Hall?
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,100 [Speaker 1]
... I think my concern with that is that
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,880 [Speaker 1]
this document ends up becoming the base
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,740 [Speaker 1]
safety study for the entire project, every
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,460 [Speaker 1]
project that flows from it. And so I, I
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,060 [Speaker 1]
would feel more comfortable if this
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,100 [Speaker 1]
specific document came back to us with
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,360 [Speaker 1]
updated concepts, um,
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,340 [Speaker 1]
as opposed to general guidance given that
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,460 [Speaker 1]
then gets incorporated in later-
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:14,900 [Speaker 8]
Certainly.
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,740 [Speaker 1]
Project designs.
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,520 [Speaker 8]
Understood.
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,100 [Speaker 5]
Okay.
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,640 [Speaker 5]
So I think we're ready to vote.
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,860 [Speaker 9]
Sure.
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,580 [Speaker 5]
Yes, Council Member Zernosky?
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,440 [Speaker 9]
I just had a question, 'cause I wanna make
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,880 [Speaker 9]
sure I'm on understanding this motion and
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,340 [Speaker 9]
understanding the direction. Um, so the
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,110 [Speaker 9]
motion is to incorporate the feedback that
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,760 [Speaker 9]
we have given into this specific
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,760 [Speaker 9]
document, bring the document back, and
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800 [Speaker 9]
then be able to move forward with any
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,820 [Speaker 9]
design
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,140 [Speaker 9]
specific, um, actions?
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,040 [Speaker 5]
Yes, with one amendment that they're gonna
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,600 [Speaker 5]
work on design concurrent, like with some
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,320 [Speaker 5]
of the, uh, items that are already kind
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,400 [Speaker 5]
of in progress-
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,840 [Speaker 8]
There's-
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:58,020 [Speaker 5]
-so that we're not gonna slow down
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,960 [Speaker 5]
anything.
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,120 [Speaker 8]
There's certain things that we can
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,820 [Speaker 8]
certainly work on related to the capital
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,640 [Speaker 8]
project-
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:02,800 [Speaker 5]
Right
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,520 [Speaker 8]
... outside of the specific treatments
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,910 [Speaker 8]
that have been discussed tonight or
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,950 [Speaker 8]
tactics. So we'll, um, certainly think
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,040 [Speaker 8]
about how we do that internally.
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,700 [Speaker 9]
Okay, and they would-- would they be able
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,680 [Speaker 9]
to bring it back to us
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,720 [Speaker 9]
in less than sixty days, should it be
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,640 [Speaker 9]
ready sooner?
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:17,650 [Speaker 5]
Yes.
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:17,860 [Speaker 9]
Okay.
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,360 [Speaker 5]
Yes.
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,920 [Speaker 9]
So we'd be able to get moving on trying to
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,450 [Speaker 9]
make Santa Monica Boulevard safer?
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,440 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, and I don't think-
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:24,450 [Speaker 9]
Okay
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,970 [Speaker 5]
... anything-- we're not precluded from
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,780 [Speaker 5]
having, like, individual briefings in the
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,060 [Speaker 5]
interim period as well, just to make sure
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,180 [Speaker 5]
everyone's on the same page.
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,740 [Speaker 9]
Okay. Thank you.
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000 [Speaker 5]
Okay, let's vote.
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,260 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Negrete?
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,100 [Speaker 1]
Yes.
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,220 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Hall?
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:38,490 [Speaker 1]
Yes.
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Raskin?
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:40,500 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,760 [Speaker 3]
Mayor Pro Tem Swick?
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,420 [Speaker 1]
Yes.
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,980 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Snell?
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,580 [Speaker 1]
Yes.
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,980 [Speaker 3]
Council Member Zernosky?
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,660 [Speaker 9]
Yes.
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,520 [Speaker 3]
And Mayor Terrosis.
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,660 [Speaker 5]
Yes. Great, um, we will now move on to
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,140 [Speaker 5]
agenda item 12B,
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,950 [Speaker 5]
and, uh, thank you all for your, uh,
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,540 [Speaker 5]
efforts. Really appreciate it. We have
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,159 [Speaker 5]
three public comments on agenda item 12B.
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,540 [Speaker 5]
Uh, just
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,920 [Speaker 5]
a, as a matter of process, do we wanna
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,639 [Speaker 5]
hear the staff report and then take the
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,060 [Speaker 5]
public comment since it's a public
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,840 [Speaker 5]
hearing?
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,720 [Speaker 3]
You did yes.
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,780 [Speaker 5]
Yes? Okay, great.
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,260 [Speaker 3]
You already have it in there?
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,160 [Speaker 5]
... Lover's going to get that
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,880 [Speaker 5]
talk.
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,100 [Speaker 10]
Great, um,
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,280 [Speaker 10]
good evening, Council. Uh, Steve Mizukami,
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,040 [Speaker 10]
as well as, Carrie Fukui, and we're here
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,250 [Speaker 10]
from City Planning, and, uh, tonight we'll
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,500 [Speaker 10]
be presenting, uh, what is this next
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,949 [Speaker 10]
phase of zoning amendments related to
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,169 [Speaker 10]
economic recovery, growth, and
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,520 [Speaker 10]
opportunity. And this is consistent with
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,420 [Speaker 10]
the city's new realignment plan,
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,300 [Speaker 10]
and also with council's direction to bring
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,330 [Speaker 10]
forth, uh, current IZO standards for
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,440 [Speaker 10]
permanent adoption. Uh, tonight's proposal
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,520 [Speaker 10]
is the latest phase of what we anticipate
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,640 [Speaker 10]
will be an ongoing series of zoning
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,060 [Speaker 10]
amendments, uh, focused on economic growth
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,280 [Speaker 10]
and opportunity. Uh, the City Council,
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,310 [Speaker 10]
uh, continues to provide support to the
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,130 [Speaker 10]
business community that has been very
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,590 [Speaker 10]
critical, uh, for economic recovery, um,
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,920 [Speaker 10]
allowing for greater flexibility in our
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,740 [Speaker 10]
land uses and review procedures for both
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,880 [Speaker 10]
new and existing, uh, Santa Monica
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,510 [Speaker 10]
businesses. Uh, most recently, the City
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,540 [Speaker 10]
Council adopted zoning amendments back in,
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,980 [Speaker 10]
uh, August of last year, uh, permanently
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,820 [Speaker 10]
adopting portions of the current downtown
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,540 [Speaker 10]
IZO, uh, which really focused on alcohol
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,820 [Speaker 10]
permit streamlining.
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,020 [Speaker 10]
Uh, since then, uh, staff has continued to
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,650 [Speaker 10]
look at additional, uh, streamlining and
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,140 [Speaker 10]
expanding, uh, the scope to the entire
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,370 [Speaker 10]
downtown, as well as the outside of the
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,449 [Speaker 10]
downtown in district citywide. Uh, we've
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,420 [Speaker 10]
received a great amount of positive
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,470 [Speaker 10]
feedback, uh, from brokers and the
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,360 [Speaker 10]
business community on the streamlining
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,470 [Speaker 10]
changes to land use review. Uh, not only
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,900 [Speaker 10]
that, uh, it provides greater certainty
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,350 [Speaker 10]
for these prospective businesses, uh, and
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,400 [Speaker 10]
also signals that the city is open for
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,790 [Speaker 10]
business,
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,280 [Speaker 10]
uh, but we've seen, uh, businesses come
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,410 [Speaker 10]
through the permitting process, uh, that
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,500 [Speaker 10]
have benefited from these changes. And so
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,580 [Speaker 10]
the feedback and the results, uh, are
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,920 [Speaker 10]
telling us that our streamlining
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,400 [Speaker 10]
strategies, uh, in the downtown are
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,589 [Speaker 10]
working. Uh, so tonight's
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,280 [Speaker 10]
proposal comes in two parts. Uh, this
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,530 [Speaker 10]
slide gives a brief overview, uh, of
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,980 [Speaker 10]
tonight's agenda. Uh, first, the formal
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,210 [Speaker 10]
adoption of all current, um, IZOs. Uh,
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,460 [Speaker 10]
second would be consideration of new
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,660 [Speaker 10]
changes within the downtown, as well as in
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,800 [Speaker 10]
the citywide districts, uh, based on the
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,760 [Speaker 10]
similar strategy that we've taken for the
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,520 [Speaker 10]
downtown IZOs. Uh, and we also have four
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,250 [Speaker 10]
policies for the council's, uh,
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,060 [Speaker 10]
consideration tonight, uh, related to, uh,
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,940 [Speaker 10]
retail size, uh, pub crawls, uh, taproom
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,490 [Speaker 10]
closing hours, and the, uh, potential
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,660 [Speaker 10]
reestablishment of bars on Main Street.
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,160 [Speaker 10]
So I'll quickly go through the four. Uh,
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,240 [Speaker 10]
we have four IZOs and a set of emergency
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,460 [Speaker 10]
order provisions that staff is re- uh,
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,870 [Speaker 10]
recommending for permanent adoption. Uh,
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,600 [Speaker 10]
that is the downtown IZO. We also have an
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,160 [Speaker 10]
IZO on sidewalk dining as well as massage.
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,620 [Speaker 10]
Uh, these were, um, through the years,
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,560 [Speaker 10]
created as IZOs, and we're, uh, seek-- uh,
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,480 [Speaker 10]
proposing to permanently adopt those
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,160 [Speaker 10]
standards. Uh, we also have a resource
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,270 [Speaker 10]
recovery and recycling IZO, um, that, uh,
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,960 [Speaker 10]
Ross will be able to go into a little bit
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,310 [Speaker 10]
further detail later tonight.
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,520 [Speaker 10]
Uh, and, uh, we also have the adoption of
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,720 [Speaker 10]
the Palisades Emergency Order, uh,
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,210 [Speaker 10]
supporting the relocation of schools and
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,716 [Speaker 10]
daycare facilities.... Uh, so additional
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:59,336 [Speaker 10]
changes in the downtown. We are proposing,
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,216 [Speaker 10]
uh, to further streamline land review,
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,636 [Speaker 10]
uh, land use review, which we've done
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:06,166 [Speaker 10]
through the current IZO. Uh, but we're
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:07,876 [Speaker 10]
also looking to expand our alcohol
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:10,016 [Speaker 10]
exemptions for commercial uses that are
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,536 [Speaker 10]
listed here, uh, that are already
00:43:12,576 --> 00:43:14,356 [Speaker 10]
available to the Third Street Promenade
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:16,836 [Speaker 10]
area. Um, and so we're looking to expand
00:43:16,896 --> 00:43:20,146 [Speaker 10]
this to the rest of the downtown area. Uh,
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:22,096 [Speaker 10]
staff also proposes to allow, uh,
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:24,796 [Speaker 10]
existing non-conforming pawnshops, uh, to
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,896 [Speaker 10]
relocate anywhere in the downtown area,
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:29,376 [Speaker 10]
except for Ocean Avenue. Uh, the council
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,666 [Speaker 10]
had considered this proposal last year,
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,736 [Speaker 10]
uh, and did not move forward with the
00:43:33,796 --> 00:43:36,116 [Speaker 10]
change at that time. Uh, so staff is
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,556 [Speaker 10]
reintroducing this, uh, change today, uh,
00:43:39,566 --> 00:43:41,876 [Speaker 10]
and wanna clarify that this is in response
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,856 [Speaker 10]
to an existing long-term Santa Monica
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:46,036 [Speaker 10]
business, uh, that would help support
00:43:46,076 --> 00:43:48,796 [Speaker 10]
their business operations. Uh, as we have
00:43:48,816 --> 00:43:50,696 [Speaker 10]
proposed the language, this simply would
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,036 [Speaker 10]
allow for any existing pawnshops to
00:43:53,076 --> 00:43:55,136 [Speaker 10]
relocate anywhere in the downtown and will
00:43:55,196 --> 00:43:57,445 [Speaker 10]
not result in any new pawnshops.
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:01,466 [Speaker 10]
Uh, next, uh, Carrie will be going over,
00:44:01,536 --> 00:44:03,396 [Speaker 10]
uh, the strategy behind the changes and
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:05,296 [Speaker 10]
also provide an overview of the new
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:07,356 [Speaker 10]
changes citywide.
00:44:09,136 --> 00:44:11,566 [Speaker 11]
Hello, good evening. Uh, thanks for having
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:13,626 [Speaker 11]
us tonight. I'm Carrie Fukui, acting
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:16,356 [Speaker 11]
principal planner. Um, as Steve mentioned,
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:18,756 [Speaker 11]
I will now be jumping into the citywide
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:19,386 [Speaker 11]
amendments.
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:21,996 [Speaker 11]
Um, before we get into what we are
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,596 [Speaker 11]
proposing tonight, I just wanted to go
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:25,946 [Speaker 11]
briefly over our general strategy of how
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:28,576 [Speaker 11]
we made these, uh, changes in our proposal
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:31,016 [Speaker 11]
before you. Um, so we really try to look
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:33,106 [Speaker 11]
at these five topics here. So one,
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:34,436 [Speaker 11]
building on the successes of recent
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:37,046 [Speaker 11]
changes made downtown. Um, targeting
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:39,286 [Speaker 11]
limitations and ground floor restrictions
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:40,826 [Speaker 11]
that are seen as barriers in what we've
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:43,756 [Speaker 11]
heard from businesses, existing and new.
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:46,286 [Speaker 11]
Um, also make sure that comparable uses
00:44:46,456 --> 00:44:48,636 [Speaker 11]
have the same limitations and restrictions
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:51,036 [Speaker 11]
in the land use process. Uh, we'll also
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:53,236 [Speaker 11]
look to remove or downgrade entitlement
00:44:53,296 --> 00:44:55,176 [Speaker 11]
processes that are time-consuming,
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,936 [Speaker 11]
expensive for applicants, and that we see
00:44:58,056 --> 00:44:59,336 [Speaker 11]
can be handled by the zoning
00:44:59,356 --> 00:44:59,956 [Speaker 11]
administrator-
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,020 [Speaker 0]
by the planning director or by staff.
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,780 [Speaker 0]
Um, and all of this is kind of happening
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,360 [Speaker 0]
in a lens where we're seeing neighborhood
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,050 [Speaker 0]
commercial
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360 [Speaker 0]
as, you know, different from our other,
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,680 [Speaker 0]
uh, boulevards. Uh, there's more
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,640 [Speaker 0]
preservation of ground floor activity. So
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,040 [Speaker 0]
everything we do kind of trickles down
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,550 [Speaker 0]
from downtown to, that's the most
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,320 [Speaker 0]
flexible, to the boulevards, and then down
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,080 [Speaker 0]
to the neighborhood commercial zone.
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,880 [Speaker 0]
Um, before jumping into the changes,
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,210 [Speaker 0]
again, I just want to go over our
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,440 [Speaker 0]
entitlement process. Um, so I'll just go
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,360 [Speaker 0]
over these briefly from the hardest
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,420 [Speaker 0]
entitlement to the easiest. So starting
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,100 [Speaker 0]
with a conditional use permit, um, you'll
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,449 [Speaker 0]
see it's pretty expensive, about ten
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,280 [Speaker 0]
thousand dollars for a land use permit,
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320 [Speaker 0]
twenty thousand dollars for alcohol. This
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,620 [Speaker 0]
goes in front of the planning commission
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,440 [Speaker 0]
for a public hearing and is appealed to
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,080 [Speaker 0]
you, the city council. Um, approval of
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,200 [Speaker 0]
this requires, uh, findings, these eight
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,860 [Speaker 0]
findings in the code. Um, and this is
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,760 [Speaker 0]
significant staff time, applicant time,
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,640 [Speaker 0]
coordination before the hearing and can
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,290 [Speaker 0]
take about anywhere from three to five
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,860 [Speaker 0]
months. Uh, next is a minor use permit, so
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,400 [Speaker 0]
a step down. It's cheaper at eight
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,820 [Speaker 0]
thousand dollars. It's in front of the
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,120 [Speaker 0]
zoning administrator for a public hearing.
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,220 [Speaker 0]
Uh, appeals to this go to the planning
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,259 [Speaker 0]
commission. Um, they're required to meet
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,020 [Speaker 0]
the same eight findings as a conditional
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,030 [Speaker 0]
use permit, so the threshold for approval
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,790 [Speaker 0]
is the same as a CUP. Um, and it takes
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,900 [Speaker 0]
much less staff and applicant prep time,
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,660 [Speaker 0]
uh, before going to a hearing, about two
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,680 [Speaker 0]
months. Uh, next is a special limitation.
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,880 [Speaker 0]
So we have limitations that apply to our
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,160 [Speaker 0]
land uses. They're standard conditions
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,040 [Speaker 0]
that must be met, whether the use is
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,600 [Speaker 0]
permitted by right or requires an
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,580 [Speaker 0]
entitlement. Some of these limitations,
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,660 [Speaker 0]
uh, you know, hit on things like max
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,220 [Speaker 0]
tenant size, uh, parking and loading
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,630 [Speaker 0]
requirements, uh, residential buffers, or
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,700 [Speaker 0]
ground floor restrictions. And then
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600 [Speaker 0]
finally, we end with just a P in the
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,940 [Speaker 0]
table, which is permitted by right. The
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400 [Speaker 0]
applicant just needs to get a business
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,100 [Speaker 0]
license. So jumping into the changes, the
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,620 [Speaker 0]
first thing we did was looked at how we
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,720 [Speaker 0]
could simplify the review process, and the
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920 [Speaker 0]
first thing we saw was, where can we
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,040 [Speaker 0]
downgrade a conditional use permit to a
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,120 [Speaker 0]
minor use permit? And to do this, we
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,680 [Speaker 0]
really looked at what uses have impacts
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,140 [Speaker 0]
that are easily identifiable, typical for
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,220 [Speaker 0]
that use, and can be mitigated with simple
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,560 [Speaker 0]
conditions. A lot of these uses that we
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,440 [Speaker 0]
looked at, the impacts are related to
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,800 [Speaker 0]
noise, parking, loading, access, RRR, all
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,440 [Speaker 0]
things that we believe can be handled, you
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880 [Speaker 0]
know, at the zoning administrator or with
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,900 [Speaker 0]
staff guidance. Um, these uses, we still
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,880 [Speaker 0]
see a value in a public hearing to address
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,070 [Speaker 0]
any community concerns, so that's why the
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,740 [Speaker 0]
MUP would be reviewed in front of the
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,680 [Speaker 0]
zoning administrator. And again, as I
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,540 [Speaker 0]
said, appealable to the PC with the eight
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,580 [Speaker 0]
required findings.
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,400 [Speaker 0]
Um, an example of a use where we
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,600 [Speaker 0]
downgraded CUP to MUP is small-scale
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,420 [Speaker 0]
facility. This is kind of a catch-all for
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,100 [Speaker 0]
a range of commercial entertainment
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,480 [Speaker 0]
businesses, a lot of what we see for
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,080 [Speaker 0]
arcades, uh, kind of pop-up, experiential
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,230 [Speaker 0]
things that we see on the promenade. Um,
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,020 [Speaker 0]
under the current regulations, these
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,880 [Speaker 0]
require a conditional use permit along all
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,880 [Speaker 0]
the boulevards. Um, we assess this use
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,210 [Speaker 0]
very typical and common to, like, a
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,989 [Speaker 0]
general retail use and as impactful as
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,640 [Speaker 0]
that, and don't see how that would rise to
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720 [Speaker 0]
the level of a conditional use permit. So
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,420 [Speaker 0]
this is one example where we downgraded
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,650 [Speaker 0]
this to an MUP, because this use can kind
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,320 [Speaker 0]
of encompass so many different things. We
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,960 [Speaker 0]
still think it should have some level of
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,180 [Speaker 0]
review. Um, so that's an example of that
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,700 [Speaker 0]
downgrade there. Um, next, we
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,520 [Speaker 0]
simplified even further, where some uses
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,240 [Speaker 0]
went from a CUP and MUP to just by right
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,580 [Speaker 0]
permitted, they just need a business
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,440 [Speaker 0]
license. Um, we really looked at in what
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,440 [Speaker 0]
instances an entitlement was used as a
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,920 [Speaker 0]
deterrent for use rather than a way to
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,500 [Speaker 0]
evaluate compatibility of a use. Because a
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,890 [Speaker 0]
conditional use permit, a minor use
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,230 [Speaker 0]
permit, it's a permitted use with
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,960 [Speaker 0]
conditions to ensure it's compatible
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,780 [Speaker 0]
rather than something we just use to say
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,350 [Speaker 0]
yes or no.
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,520 [Speaker 0]
Um, so we looked at specific conditions on
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,890 [Speaker 0]
recently approved entitlements to see,
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,730 [Speaker 0]
you know, what were the greatest concerns,
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200 [Speaker 0]
what were the typical conditions placed
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,880 [Speaker 0]
on these entitlements, and again, a lot
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,040 [Speaker 0]
were related to parking, loading, and
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,670 [Speaker 0]
operations. Um, so we also see this as
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080 [Speaker 0]
something that could be just required and
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,460 [Speaker 0]
handled at the staff level.
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,720 [Speaker 0]
Um, another thing we looked at here was
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,470 [Speaker 0]
removing inconsistent application of
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,220 [Speaker 0]
entitlements. So there were a lot of
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,320 [Speaker 0]
comparable uses that had to go through a
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,350 [Speaker 0]
different process, um, which could have
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,070 [Speaker 0]
just happened over time as the code was
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,060 [Speaker 0]
created. So we just try to look at those
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,400 [Speaker 0]
uses and target them and make sure they're
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,050 [Speaker 0]
all treated the same. Uh, one example of
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,780 [Speaker 0]
this one...
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,899 [Speaker 0]
Let's see. So we actually are streamlining
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,700 [Speaker 0]
offices, starting in the downtown, where
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,110 [Speaker 0]
offices are really permitted everywhere by
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,800 [Speaker 0]
right. Um, under new-- under current
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,340 [Speaker 0]
code, all new construction of office uses
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,100 [Speaker 0]
requires a conditional use permit on the
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,180 [Speaker 0]
boulevards. Um, so we saw this as pretty
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,390 [Speaker 0]
onerous, um, and we also looked at
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,350 [Speaker 0]
existing entitlements that were recently
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,910 [Speaker 0]
issued, and a lot of the special
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,340 [Speaker 0]
conditions were related to, uh, building
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,950 [Speaker 0]
design or kind of how it interacts with
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,680 [Speaker 0]
the street, not necessarily around the
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,140 [Speaker 0]
business function or the operations there.
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,640 [Speaker 0]
So this is one example of where we
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,380 [Speaker 0]
changed a use from a MUP, CUP to straight
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,660 [Speaker 0]
by right. And again, we looked at NC a
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,340 [Speaker 0]
little differently, where we saw this as,
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,100 [Speaker 0]
you know, we want to maintain kind of the
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,060 [Speaker 0]
active use feel of Main Street in the
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,050 [Speaker 0]
smaller scale, so we left some of those,
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720 [Speaker 0]
uh, restrictions in for there.
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,640 [Speaker 0]
And next, we looked at simplifying
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,260 [Speaker 0]
restrictions and limitations for the
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,620 [Speaker 0]
ground floor. Um, so these are limitations
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,140 [Speaker 0]
in the land use table that could put
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,340 [Speaker 0]
restrictions on how big a tenant space can
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,220 [Speaker 0]
be or the actual frontage of that
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,680 [Speaker 0]
storefront. Um, this is forced, as we've
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,260 [Speaker 0]
seen through business license review,
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,740 [Speaker 0]
applicants to seek loopholes. They face
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,280 [Speaker 0]
very time-consuming and expensive process.
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,220 [Speaker 0]
They redesign their floor plans, or they
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,680 [Speaker 0]
chop up tenant spaces, all to just end up
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,770 [Speaker 0]
in this space anyways. So we looked at
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,140 [Speaker 0]
this and, you know, where could we remove
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,800 [Speaker 0]
this, and where will it not have a major
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,000 [Speaker 0]
impact on our boulevards? Um, and we just
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,340 [Speaker 0]
want to note that throughout all of this
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,420 [Speaker 0]
design review is still part of the
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,790 [Speaker 0]
process, so any kind of concerns about,
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,380 [Speaker 0]
uh, frontage or building design, that will
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,608 [Speaker 0]
still be handled through the ARV.... Um,
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:02,088 [Speaker 0]
so an example of this is, uh, banks,
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:03,928 [Speaker 0]
actually. So in the downtown, the DCP
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:05,808 [Speaker 0]
previously restricted bank frontages to
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,148 [Speaker 0]
twenty feet. Um, and on the boulevards, we
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,968 [Speaker 0]
had frontage restrictions for things like
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,768 [Speaker 0]
retail and general personal services,
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:15,228 [Speaker 0]
which are nail salons, dry cleaners,
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:18,128 [Speaker 0]
tailors, all very common uses. Um, we
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,068 [Speaker 0]
reviewed these, and we don't see any real
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:23,468 [Speaker 0]
mitigation that that limitation does on an
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,168 [Speaker 0]
impacted use. Um, so we removed these,
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,748 [Speaker 0]
you know, and it just definitely helps
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:29,728 [Speaker 0]
with re-tenanting of some long-term vacant
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,388 [Speaker 0]
spaces.
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,668 [Speaker 0]
So next here, I'm gonna jump into some
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,858 [Speaker 0]
more specific examples of what we did. Um,
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,938 [Speaker 0]
retail strategy is one that had some, uh,
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,448 [Speaker 0]
bigger changes for the city. Currently,
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,068 [Speaker 0]
you'll see at the top row our existing
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:47,608 [Speaker 0]
regulations. Sm-- uh, retail is broken
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:49,248 [Speaker 0]
into at least three categories of small,
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:51,908 [Speaker 0]
medium, large. All throughout existing
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:53,288 [Speaker 0]
staff proposal and the planning
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,988 [Speaker 0]
commission's proposal, everything small
00:06:55,068 --> 00:06:56,828 [Speaker 0]
scale within that category is permitted by
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:59,128 [Speaker 0]
right. Um, what we're really seeing
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:01,028 [Speaker 0]
change is here in this middle column, in
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,128 [Speaker 0]
medium scale, where right now, existing
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,288 [Speaker 0]
regulations require a CUP. Staff proposal
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,188 [Speaker 0]
is to change that either to a minor use
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,088 [Speaker 0]
permit when close to residential
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:12,488 [Speaker 0]
neighborhoods or just permitted by right
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,008 [Speaker 0]
with approval of a parking loading
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:16,738 [Speaker 0]
operations plan. Um, and I wanna note in
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,018 [Speaker 0]
the record that the staff report actually
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,088 [Speaker 0]
misidentified planning commission's
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:22,958 [Speaker 0]
recommendation on this. So this
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,388 [Speaker 0]
clarification here is that they actually
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,178 [Speaker 0]
weren't changing the definition, they just
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,328 [Speaker 0]
wanted to change the threshold of which a
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:32,148 [Speaker 0]
CUP is required. So in a medium-scale
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:34,448 [Speaker 0]
retail, everything between twenty-five and
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:36,528 [Speaker 0]
fifty thousand square feet is approved
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,048 [Speaker 0]
through a minor use permit, similar to
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,748 [Speaker 0]
staff proposal, but above fifty and up to
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,408 [Speaker 0]
eighty requires a CUP. So the difference
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,728 [Speaker 0]
here between staff and PC is that staff's
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,428 [Speaker 0]
is a little more flexible, where anything
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:50,108 [Speaker 0]
within medium scale is just a MUP or a
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,308 [Speaker 0]
PLOP.
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,468 [Speaker 0]
So that's our first policy question
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,808 [Speaker 0]
tonight that we'll bring back up later.
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,538 [Speaker 0]
Um, if a CUP should be required for
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:01,188 [Speaker 0]
anything over fifty thousand square feet
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:03,888 [Speaker 0]
for medium-scale retail, uh, this means
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,078 [Speaker 0]
that that CUP is required. Anything
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:07,607 [Speaker 0]
between twenty-five and fifty is more
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,588 [Speaker 0]
flexible with the MUP. Um, so the yes
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,158 [Speaker 0]
would be aligned with planning
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,128 [Speaker 0]
commission's recommendation of the CUP
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,408 [Speaker 0]
between fifty and eighty, or a no would be
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:19,588 [Speaker 0]
with staff's recommendation.
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,508 [Speaker 0]
And next, I am gonna go over, uh, grocery
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,428 [Speaker 0]
stores. So this was another pretty big
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:26,768 [Speaker 0]
change that we made through the city.
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:30,848 [Speaker 0]
Existing regulations require a CUP for any
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,528 [Speaker 0]
grocery store over fifteen thousand
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,818 [Speaker 0]
square feet, and that counts for a grocery
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,498 [Speaker 0]
store going into an existing building or
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:38,928 [Speaker 0]
new construction. Um, we've seen this as a
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,668 [Speaker 0]
barrier over the last year for difficulty
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:43,888 [Speaker 0]
of re-tenanting very large tenant spaces.
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,748 [Speaker 0]
We have that Rite Aid site that's over
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:47,848 [Speaker 0]
fifteen thousand, and a grocery store came
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,177 [Speaker 0]
to us and was looking at how they can
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,908 [Speaker 0]
break up the space. Um, so our proposal is
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,268 [Speaker 0]
really addressing that. Um, you know, and
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,708 [Speaker 0]
we've heard from our mo- partners in
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:57,688 [Speaker 0]
mobility that some existing grocery
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,087 [Speaker 0]
stores, the biggest issues are the
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:01,168 [Speaker 0]
loading, the parking, and the operations.
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,397 [Speaker 0]
So that's why you'll see in both staff and
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:06,068 [Speaker 0]
PC proposals, will always require the
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,988 [Speaker 0]
approval of a PLOP for any new grocery
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,428 [Speaker 0]
store in the city now. Um, and staff
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,488 [Speaker 0]
proposal is for new construction, a minor
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,728 [Speaker 0]
use permit only when the grocery store
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,498 [Speaker 0]
proposes greater than twenty-five thousand
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,468 [Speaker 0]
square feet. Anything below that is
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:22,148 [Speaker 0]
permitted by right with the PLOP. PC went
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,748 [Speaker 0]
above and beyond and, uh, increased that
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:26,348 [Speaker 0]
threshold to thirty thousand square feet
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,337 [Speaker 0]
with staff support. Uh, a lot of this was
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,698 [Speaker 0]
based off research we had done that showed
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,808 [Speaker 0]
the average and median size of grocery
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:34,158 [Speaker 0]
stores was between twenty-five and
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:35,908 [Speaker 0]
twenty-eight thousand, so that thirty just
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:37,598 [Speaker 0]
really makes sure it captures everything.
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:41,868 [Speaker 0]
And with that, I'm gonna pass it back to
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,448 [Speaker 0]
Steve to go over alcohol.
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:49,218 [Speaker 1]
Great, so this next, uh, section is, uh,
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,108 [Speaker 1]
staff's proposed changes to our alcohol
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:53,688 [Speaker 1]
permits. Um, so first, uh, we are
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:56,908 [Speaker 1]
proposing to first downgrade the baseline,
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,868 [Speaker 1]
uh, conditional use permit required for
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:01,088 [Speaker 1]
all of our alcohol permits, uh, and we
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,848 [Speaker 1]
would be downgrading that from a CUP to an
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:07,128 [Speaker 1]
MUP, minor use permit. Uh, expess- except
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,208 [Speaker 1]
that bars would continue to require a
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,408 [Speaker 1]
conditional use permit, and that was, uh,
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:12,768 [Speaker 1]
something that was recommended by the
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,228 [Speaker 1]
planning commission. Uh, the
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:18,068 [Speaker 1]
alcohol-related suspensions, uh, per the
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,748 [Speaker 1]
emergency order, um, are proposed to be
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,938 [Speaker 1]
formally removed as alcohol, uh,
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:24,588 [Speaker 1]
requirements in our permits moving
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:27,048 [Speaker 1]
forward. And we've also created a process
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,398 [Speaker 1]
where existing businesses can also simply
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,868 [Speaker 1]
request that those same conditions be
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,788 [Speaker 1]
removed from their current alcohol
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,858 [Speaker 1]
permits. Uh, a lot of these,
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,568 [Speaker 1]
uh, uh, regulations kinda spanned, uh,
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,268 [Speaker 1]
many years in the past, so there's a lot
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,088 [Speaker 1]
of permits out there that they are
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:45,338 [Speaker 1]
complying, uh, you know, subject to these
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:47,308 [Speaker 1]
requirements. We wanna allow for existing
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,798 [Speaker 1]
businesses to be able to come in and also,
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:52,918 [Speaker 1]
uh, get that, as well as new, uh, new
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,488 [Speaker 1]
applications for permits. Uh, the planning
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:58,308 [Speaker 1]
commission, uh, did recommend to maintain
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,548 [Speaker 1]
the p- uh, the pub crawl restriction,
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:03,608 [Speaker 1]
uh, and they expressed, uh, some safety
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,028 [Speaker 1]
concerns with participating patrons as
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,788 [Speaker 1]
they're jumping from business to business.
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,668 [Speaker 1]
Um, and so policy question number two for
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,788 [Speaker 1]
council, uh, is whether it would be
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:15,358 [Speaker 1]
appropriate to continue the allowance of
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:17,938 [Speaker 1]
the pub crawl events, uh, consistent with
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:23,048 [Speaker 1]
the emergency order. Um, so, uh, next is
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:24,238 [Speaker 1]
our alcohol, uh,
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:27,108 [Speaker 1]
exemptions. So, uh, we've taken a similar
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,328 [Speaker 1]
approach with expanding, uh, alcohol
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,588 [Speaker 1]
exemptions to districts outside of the
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,168 [Speaker 1]
downtown, uh, but with a much shorter list
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:37,048 [Speaker 1]
of potential uses in comparison. Uh,
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:38,998 [Speaker 1]
staff presented this, uh, concept to the
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,728 [Speaker 1]
planning commission, uh, as policy
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:42,408 [Speaker 1]
questions in which the commission was
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:45,248 [Speaker 1]
supportive of. Uh, so this would include,
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,578 [Speaker 1]
uh, food courts being added, um, and
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:50,448 [Speaker 1]
businesses such as art galleries, uh, day
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:53,388 [Speaker 1]
spas, beauty shops, uh, retail shops that
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:55,828 [Speaker 1]
are not typically associated with
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,948 [Speaker 1]
alcohol-related issues. Uh, these new
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,288 [Speaker 1]
businesses would be able to apply for an
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,672 [Speaker 1]
alcohol exemption permit. Um-... Um,
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,592 [Speaker 1]
taprooms is a new category, uh, being
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,452 [Speaker 1]
introduced, uh, with this group. Uh, it
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:10,432 [Speaker 1]
would be limited to the service of beer
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,052 [Speaker 1]
and wine, uh, only, so we would not have
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,902 [Speaker 1]
spirits as a part of that definition. Um,
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,692 [Speaker 1]
and this looks to address, like, newer
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,712 [Speaker 1]
trends of businesses such as, um,
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:22,792 [Speaker 1]
JuneShine on Main Street, that is
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,132 [Speaker 1]
considered a bar, uh, since they, they,
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,612 [Speaker 1]
they do not have food service. Uh, so this
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:30,292 [Speaker 1]
group is also may include wine bars in
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,412 [Speaker 1]
this category. Uh, and we're looking to
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:34,591 [Speaker 1]
provide an easier path for these more
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:36,912 [Speaker 1]
innocuous businesses, uh, that do get
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:40,192 [Speaker 1]
caught up under the bar classification.
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:41,702 [Speaker 1]
Uh, the Planning Commission supported the
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,432 [Speaker 1]
addition of this taproom category, uh, and
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,852 [Speaker 1]
recommended a closing hour of nine PM for
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:49,112 [Speaker 1]
these businesses. Uh, considering that
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:51,092 [Speaker 1]
the closing hours for alcohol exemptions
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:53,452 [Speaker 1]
for restaurants are at twelve AM, uh,
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,992 [Speaker 1]
staff does propose the closing time to
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,472 [Speaker 1]
align with these restaurants for
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,142 [Speaker 1]
consistency. Uh, so policy question number
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:00,732 [Speaker 1]
three:
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,432 [Speaker 1]
uh, should the closing times be nine PM,
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:07,492 [Speaker 1]
uh, or twelve AM for taprooms seeking an
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,712 [Speaker 1]
alcohol exemption permit?
00:13:11,392 --> 00:13:13,422 [Speaker 1]
Uh, next category, moving on from alcohol,
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,602 [Speaker 1]
uh, here is a list of minor changes that
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:18,832 [Speaker 1]
simplify standards for these various uses.
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:21,162 [Speaker 1]
Uh, I will, uh, highlight one. Uh, all
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,972 [Speaker 1]
forms of exercise and physical fitness,
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:26,272 [Speaker 1]
uh, for example, would now be permitted by
00:13:26,332 --> 00:13:28,652 [Speaker 1]
right. Uh, whereas in most cases right
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,672 [Speaker 1]
now, a conditional use permit is required.
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:36,432 [Speaker 1]
Um, uh, we'll go on to our last policy
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,372 [Speaker 1]
question. So following the Planning
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,042 [Speaker 1]
Commission's review, um, and
00:13:40,072 --> 00:13:42,482 [Speaker 1]
recommendation of the proposed amendments,
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:44,652 [Speaker 1]
uh, staff proposes an additional change,
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,362 [Speaker 1]
uh, in response to the condit- uh,
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,632 [Speaker 1]
Commission's overall discussion about
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:52,032 [Speaker 1]
alcohol. Uh, and we do propose to allow
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:55,052 [Speaker 1]
existing bar establishments located in the
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:57,552 [Speaker 1]
NC district on Main Street, uh, that have
00:13:57,572 --> 00:13:59,112 [Speaker 1]
been closed for more than twelve months
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:02,252 [Speaker 1]
to be able to have the right to reopen.
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,052 [Speaker 1]
Uh, currently, non-conforming standards
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,232 [Speaker 1]
would require a bar, uh, that has been
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,892 [Speaker 1]
closed for more than twelve months to
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,022 [Speaker 1]
convert to a conforming use in the
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,631 [Speaker 1]
district. Uh, since bars are not permitted
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:14,932 [Speaker 1]
in this district, a new bar, uh, would
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:17,532 [Speaker 1]
not be able to be approved, and therefore,
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,892 [Speaker 1]
this change seeks to preserve the
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:22,972 [Speaker 1]
opportunity for existing bars to reopen
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,752 [Speaker 1]
and avoid permanent termination.
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,932 [Speaker 1]
Now, this is the same provision that is
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,312 [Speaker 1]
currently in place, uh, that we have for
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,652 [Speaker 1]
bars within the downtown. Uh, and for
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:35,042 [Speaker 1]
other, uh... We also have this available
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,792 [Speaker 1]
for other types of uses, uh, uh, mainly
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,912 [Speaker 1]
like restaurants and retail, uh, to be
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:42,701 [Speaker 1]
able to allow for those, uh, that were,
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:44,212 [Speaker 1]
uh, having a difficult time for
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:46,782 [Speaker 1]
reoccupying, to be able to reoccupy,
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,332 [Speaker 1]
provided that there, uh, isn't a
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:51,672 [Speaker 1]
conforming use, and that's the last known
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,432 [Speaker 1]
use of that tenant space. Uh, this
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:56,212 [Speaker 1]
proposal would also help maintain the
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:58,792 [Speaker 1]
variety of commercial uses, uh, that Main
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:02,372 [Speaker 1]
Street has historically provided. Uh, so
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:04,722 [Speaker 1]
pol- uh, policy question number four: Uh,
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,432 [Speaker 1]
should, uh, previously... Oh, yeah.
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,772 [Speaker 1]
Previously, uh, operating bars that have
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:12,072 [Speaker 1]
closed in the NC district be allowed to
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,092 [Speaker 1]
reopen if the bar has been closed for more
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:16,672 [Speaker 1]
than twelve months?
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:19,002 [Speaker 1]
Yeah,
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:25,412 [Speaker 1]
just for one second. Okay.
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,562 [Speaker 1]
Sorry, it looks like a couple of slides
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,072 [Speaker 1]
were not included, but I just wanted to go
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,432 [Speaker 1]
over a couple of new revisions that were
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,172 [Speaker 1]
not included in your packet, or I guess I
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:35,162 [Speaker 1]
should say, uh, removal of amendments, uh,
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:38,092 [Speaker 1]
related to the trash rooms, uh, for our R
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,102 [Speaker 1]
requirements. Um,
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,472 [Speaker 1]
the proposed amendments, we're looking to
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:43,452 [Speaker 1]
increase them. This largely was started
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:45,732 [Speaker 1]
with the self-certification program. But
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,862 [Speaker 1]
as we moved into codifying them into the
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:50,332 [Speaker 1]
code, we've heard from developers and
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,002 [Speaker 1]
architects regarding some of their
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,582 [Speaker 1]
concerns regarding this increase. So at
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,412 [Speaker 1]
this time, staff is acr- actually
00:15:56,432 --> 00:15:58,862 [Speaker 1]
recommending to just revert back to what
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:01,432 [Speaker 1]
they are right now. Um, so to not kind of
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,742 [Speaker 1]
move forward with the amendments in your
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:05,212 [Speaker 1]
packet, uh, to give staff more time to
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,252 [Speaker 1]
more holistically look at kind of all
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,472 [Speaker 1]
trash operations before we kinda propose
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:11,532 [Speaker 1]
any additional recommendations. So just to
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,152 [Speaker 1]
kind of, on the record, to read it, it'd
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,932 [Speaker 1]
be remove- it would be going back to
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,832 [Speaker 1]
twenty-one feet and seven point five feet
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,492 [Speaker 1]
for three to s- ten units, and keeping the
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:23,492 [Speaker 1]
twenty-one-foot width for eleven to
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,992 [Speaker 1]
twenty units. And similarly, that would
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,762 [Speaker 1]
actually go along for both the commercial
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:30,822 [Speaker 1]
and, or non-residential and residential,
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:33,242 [Speaker 1]
um, tables. So sorry, we didn't have those
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,652 [Speaker 1]
slides, but just wanted to, uh, go over
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:38,412 [Speaker 1]
those quick edits.
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:42,192 [Speaker 1]
All right, so that, uh, concludes the
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,812 [Speaker 1]
staff's report. Um, we recommend that
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:47,282 [Speaker 1]
council adopt the proposed amendments, uh,
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,802 [Speaker 1]
tonight, as discussed in the staff
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:51,032 [Speaker 1]
report, and our staff is available for any
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,652 [Speaker 1]
questions.
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:58,392 [Speaker 2]
Uh, don't, don't all jump at once. Council
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,572 [Speaker 2]
Member Zwick, go ahead. He's really quick
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:03,212 [Speaker 2]
at getting in there.
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:05,942 [Speaker 3]
Um, do we do public comment after, after
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:06,742 [Speaker 3]
our own questions? Is that what we do?
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:07,712 [Speaker 2]
Oh, thank you.
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:08,322 [Speaker 3]
No, is that... I'm sorry.
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,462 [Speaker 2]
Uh, Ms. Anderson Warren, should we do
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,752 [Speaker 2]
public comment now?
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,362 [Speaker 4]
Yeah, generally, generally, you, uh, take
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,082 [Speaker 4]
questions of staff first, and then-
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:15,082 [Speaker 3]
Okay.
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:15,882 [Speaker 4]
Because then the public-
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:17,842 [Speaker 2]
Thank you, Director Warren
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:17,842 [Speaker 4]
... has the benefit of those-
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:17,842 [Speaker 2]
Got it
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:18,372 [Speaker 4]
... um, questions and answers.
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:18,772 [Speaker 2]
Okay, great.
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:18,782 [Speaker 3]
Okay.
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:19,932 [Speaker 2]
So questions only now.
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,452 [Speaker 3]
Okay. Well, just slip in that I'm really
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,652 [Speaker 3]
jazzed about all this. Uh,
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:30,262 [Speaker 3]
but, uh, on the topic of questions, uh,
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:34,332 [Speaker 3]
so I just wanna parse through some of the
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:37,012 [Speaker 3]
CUP, MUP, alcohol exemption
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,192 [Speaker 3]
elements here. Uh,
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:43,402 [Speaker 3]
w- we're moving to MUP for most of these,
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:45,012 [Speaker 3]
uh, establishments that
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,812 [Speaker 3]
protect-- that could potentially now
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:49,692 [Speaker 3]
qualify for an alcohol exemption under
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,792 [Speaker 3]
certain standards. Is that correct?
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,872 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, so that's the change from CUP to
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,632 [Speaker 1]
MUP. So all of our alcohol permits really
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:00,602 [Speaker 1]
just start off at... Currently, right now,
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,562 [Speaker 1]
it's a CUP, but we are proposing they
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:05,512 [Speaker 1]
start off at an MUP. Uh, if an al- uh, if
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:09,152 [Speaker 1]
a business can, uh, agrees to, um,
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,912 [Speaker 1]
the alcohol exemption criteria, they can
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,112 [Speaker 1]
propo- uh, apply for that, get that
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:16,612 [Speaker 1]
permit, and then they wouldn't have a, a
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,112 [Speaker 1]
minor use permit.
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:21,966 [Speaker 3]
Okay, um, it seems like we're-... tr-
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,666 [Speaker 3]
dancing around, trying to allow these, all
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,936 [Speaker 3]
these things more easily, but still
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,346 [Speaker 3]
saying essentially that bars are not
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:31,816 [Speaker 3]
allowed anywhere, essentially?
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,516 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, it was a, uh, policy question that
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:36,036 [Speaker 1]
we did talk to the commission for. Uh, it
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:38,936 [Speaker 1]
was one use that they still felt, uh, that
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,946 [Speaker 1]
still warranted, um, some, uh,
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:44,256 [Speaker 1]
discretionary review. Um,
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,776 [Speaker 1]
the, any of the processes for bars, uh,
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,756 [Speaker 1]
have always traditionally required CUPs in
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,366 [Speaker 1]
the past. Um, so, but it is a question
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,816 [Speaker 1]
that we've, we've asked.
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:56,346 [Speaker 3]
Okay, yeah, just 'cause it's like we're,
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,566 [Speaker 3]
we're, we're trying- we're introducing
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,146 [Speaker 3]
this new category called taprooms, which
00:18:59,176 --> 00:19:01,666 [Speaker 3]
is great. We- we're, we're doing this
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:03,656 [Speaker 3]
dance to keep these existing bars that we
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:05,056 [Speaker 3]
like, we're trying to keep them in
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,236 [Speaker 3]
service, but we're still making it
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:08,236 [Speaker 3]
illegal, essentially. And I'm, I'm
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:11,776 [Speaker 3]
curious, uh, uh, i- there i- I guess, is
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:14,336 [Speaker 3]
there a possibility, just so I understand,
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:16,936 [Speaker 3]
maybe for the future, whereby there could
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:17,336 [Speaker 3]
be
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:22,436 [Speaker 3]
a MUP process for bars that if they meet
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,366 [Speaker 3]
specific standards related to noise, uh,
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:26,636 [Speaker 3]
other things of that nature, outdoor
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,256 [Speaker 3]
patios, I'm not sure, you know, distance
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:31,406 [Speaker 3]
from residential uses, could then qualify
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,816 [Speaker 3]
for an alcohol exemption through that
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:33,796 [Speaker 3]
process?
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:35,416 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, if the council would like to give
00:19:35,516 --> 00:19:38,086 [Speaker 1]
staff direction. Um, again, this is, uh,
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,836 [Speaker 1]
just kind of the beginning as we're
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,376 [Speaker 1]
reaching citywide, so there's gonna be a
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,536 [Speaker 1]
lot of opportunities in the future, uh,
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,856 [Speaker 1]
for us to kind of self-correct or even
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,196 [Speaker 1]
further enhance changes that we make
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:50,616 [Speaker 1]
tonight. Uh, so yeah, that could be some
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,876 [Speaker 1]
research that we could take a look at
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:52,436 [Speaker 1]
that.
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,456 [Speaker 3]
Okay, awesome. Um, I'm, I'm trying to hold
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:55,736 [Speaker 3]
back from all the excitement I have
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:57,476 [Speaker 3]
generally about this. I'm just focusing on
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:58,906 [Speaker 3]
the questions. Uh,
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,636 [Speaker 3]
there's some ongoing restrictions on the
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,676 [Speaker 3]
office campus related to certain... a
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,396 [Speaker 3]
number of uses, uh, that are restricted to
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:11,396 [Speaker 3]
twenty-five percent of office campus.
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,146 [Speaker 3]
Uh, s- I think they're termed Special
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:16,656 [Speaker 3]
Limitation 6 on a number of uses, like you
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,646 [Speaker 3]
can have a grocery, but not a bodega, or
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:19,736 [Speaker 3]
I don't know what.
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:22,566 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, so, you know, we had heard this, and
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:24,176 [Speaker 0]
we saw those limitations, and we were
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:27,256 [Speaker 0]
looking at untangling that, and it started
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,126 [Speaker 0]
to get kind of unwieldy and turned into,
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:30,696 [Speaker 0]
like, a bigger look at, you know, how are
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,066 [Speaker 0]
we gonna address these land use
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,216 [Speaker 0]
regulations for this whole office campus
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,256 [Speaker 0]
district. Um, so it's something that we
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,576 [Speaker 0]
wanna bring forward in a next iteration.
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,176 [Speaker 3]
Okay, awesome. Yeah, 'cause I-- obviously,
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,936 [Speaker 3]
now that housing is an allowed use, it
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:42,856 [Speaker 3]
feels like we wanna allow-
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,116 [Speaker 0]
Right
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:43,766 [Speaker 3]
... other uses that can compliment that.
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,016 [Speaker 0]
Definitely. Neighborhood commercial
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:46,256 [Speaker 0]
serving uses and things like that.
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:46,786 [Speaker 3]
Yeah. Okay.
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:47,116 [Speaker 1]
Mm-hmm.
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,836 [Speaker 3]
Thank you. And then trash room, I won't go
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:52,656 [Speaker 3]
into it. It sounds like we're not really
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:54,405 [Speaker 3]
dealing with that right now. I would say
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:56,446 [Speaker 3]
that I do appreciate that we, I think, are
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:58,206 [Speaker 3]
trying... That we are making changes. I,
00:20:58,296 --> 00:20:59,416 [Speaker 3]
I think, are we still making changes
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:01,296 [Speaker 3]
related to larger projects? 'Cause that
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:03,356 [Speaker 3]
was something that I think was appreciated
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,736 [Speaker 3]
regarding that being a more streamlined
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:06,316 [Speaker 3]
process-
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:06,576 [Speaker 5]
Yes
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:07,376 [Speaker 3]
- for larger projects.
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,416 [Speaker 5]
We did remove the requirement for a public
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:12,056 [Speaker 5]
works director to kind of decide for the
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:14,296 [Speaker 5]
larger projects to kind of all hone into
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:15,776 [Speaker 5]
this table, so there's more clear,
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,245 [Speaker 5]
objective standards for all projects
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:18,096 [Speaker 5]
moving forward.
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,216 [Speaker 3]
Got it. And, and then on the smaller ones,
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:21,836 [Speaker 3]
I appreciate that we're sort of maybe
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:23,766 [Speaker 3]
gonna look at that more holistically.
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:24,896 [Speaker 5]
Yes.
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,616 [Speaker 3]
Uh, i- I've heard that other jurisdictions
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,276 [Speaker 3]
sometimes look more at, like, square
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,396 [Speaker 3]
footage as opposed to specific dimensions
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,806 [Speaker 3]
as a way to maybe allow for more
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,156 [Speaker 3]
flexibility. Is that correct?
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,066 [Speaker 5]
Yeah, and we've started those
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,066 [Speaker 5]
conversations.
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:35,905 [Speaker 3]
Okay, awesome.
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:35,905 [Speaker 5]
Yeah.
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:36,576 [Speaker 3]
Thank you so much.
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:42,116 [Speaker 6]
Great. Council Member Zernitzky, uh...
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:43,896 [Speaker 7]
Thank you. Um,
00:21:44,676 --> 00:21:47,536 [Speaker 7]
I'm so excited about these, these, uh,
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:50,096 [Speaker 7]
cleanups. Uh, I wanted to get some
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:52,596 [Speaker 7]
clarification because I, I think I'm not
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:54,656 [Speaker 7]
understanding something here when it comes
00:21:54,696 --> 00:21:57,116 [Speaker 7]
to the prohibition on pub crawls, because
00:21:57,196 --> 00:22:00,116 [Speaker 7]
I know we have some pub crawls as events
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:03,486 [Speaker 7]
throughout the year. What is, what is this
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:06,596 [Speaker 7]
prohibition on pub crawls?
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,356 [Speaker 1]
So the pro, uh, the pub crawl prohibition,
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:09,936 [Speaker 1]
um-
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:10,796 [Speaker 6]
I mean, we're happy-
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,356 [Speaker 1]
... uh, th-
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:16,836 [Speaker 1]
they're a part of, um, our alcohol permits
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:19,536 [Speaker 1]
kind of just over the years. Um, this
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:22,056 [Speaker 1]
would be a permi- a prohibition, as it
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:25,106 [Speaker 1]
currently is, uh, on businesses from
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,596 [Speaker 1]
holding events where, you know, you can
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,696 [Speaker 1]
have a couple of businesses on Main Street
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:31,976 [Speaker 1]
or, or whatnot, get together, create an
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,956 [Speaker 1]
event, and have a pub crawl. So the
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:36,336 [Speaker 1]
restriction just doesn't allow for the
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,035 [Speaker 1]
alcohol permit holders to be able to kinda
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:41,136 [Speaker 1]
organize or participate in something.
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:43,116 [Speaker 1]
Now, fast-forward to where we are
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:45,676 [Speaker 1]
currently today, and pub crawls, we've
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,176 [Speaker 1]
seen these events. We've have
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:49,896 [Speaker 1]
a handful on Main Street that we've seen.
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,336 [Speaker 1]
Uh, those are a little bit more organized,
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:54,056 [Speaker 1]
but nonetheless, uh, we do have an
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:57,246 [Speaker 1]
environment, such as the EZ, the downtown,
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:00,156 [Speaker 1]
for all of our patrons to be able to walk
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:01,916 [Speaker 1]
down the sidewalk with alcohol within the
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:04,636 [Speaker 1]
Third Street Promenade. So we do have
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:06,196 [Speaker 1]
something of a change of policy, and I
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:09,776 [Speaker 1]
think, uh, the council, um, wanted to
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:13,056 [Speaker 1]
include these suspensions for these more,
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,486 [Speaker 1]
um, arduous type of conditions on our
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:18,456 [Speaker 1]
current operators, and so in the emergency
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:21,376 [Speaker 1]
order, it's been suspended, um, as kind
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,516 [Speaker 1]
of that change of, of thought process. So
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:27,916 [Speaker 1]
as we're looking to, uh, you know, get
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:30,486 [Speaker 1]
these into the code permanently, um, you
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:32,926 [Speaker 1]
know, staff had pr- uh, recommended that
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:35,456 [Speaker 1]
pub crawls also be included in this batch
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,116 [Speaker 1]
of, uh, removals. Uh, but it-- the
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:39,416 [Speaker 1]
planning commission did share some
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:42,976 [Speaker 1]
concerns about, uh, overall safety.
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,616 [Speaker 7]
So if we were to, um,
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,976 [Speaker 7]
remove a prohibition on pub crawls, does
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,116 [Speaker 7]
that just mean that the, uh, alcohol
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:54,756 [Speaker 7]
license holders would be able to be part
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:58,576 [Speaker 7]
of a group that organizes or potentially
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:00,356 [Speaker 7]
manages a pub crawl?
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:00,976 [Speaker 1]
That's correct.
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:01,496 [Speaker 7]
Mm.
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:02,256 [Speaker 1]
Yeah.
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,756 [Speaker 7]
But it wouldn't preclude any third parties
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,036 [Speaker 7]
from, uh,
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:09,876 [Speaker 7]
working with them to organize something? I
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,316 [Speaker 7]
mean, uh, d- I assume they currently work
00:24:12,356 --> 00:24:14,656 [Speaker 7]
with them, right? They have to.
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:15,316 [Speaker 1]
Right.
00:24:16,436 --> 00:24:17,616 [Speaker 1]
It would not preclude, uh,
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,636 [Speaker 1]
anybody from preventing pub crawls.
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:23,984 [Speaker 7]
Got it. Yeah, I-... I remember in Berlin,
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:26,184 [Speaker 7]
I went on an alternative pub crawl once.
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:29,064 [Speaker 7]
It was really, it was really fun! We went
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,274 [Speaker 7]
to an absinthe bar, we went to a, a
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:33,064 [Speaker 7]
tabletop tennis bar, and went to a couple
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:36,714 [Speaker 7]
others. Um, and, you know, maybe folks
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:38,964 [Speaker 7]
might decide to create some sort of themed
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,674 [Speaker 7]
pub crawl to highlight places. Um,
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:47,714 [Speaker 7]
does this- do these amendments also- would
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:49,074 [Speaker 7]
these amendments also
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:52,394 [Speaker 7]
allow for things like corner stores and,
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:53,614 [Speaker 7]
and things like that? Or is that
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:54,424 [Speaker 7]
potentially some
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,584 [Speaker 7]
part of a future update?
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,724 [Speaker 0]
Um, so you mean like convenience markets
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:01,584 [Speaker 0]
and things like that?
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:01,814 [Speaker 7]
Yeah.
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:05,014 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, so we've released the use, um,
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:06,924 [Speaker 0]
especially in the downtown, it's just more
00:25:06,944 --> 00:25:08,684 [Speaker 0]
about the alcohol permit, so that's a
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:10,544 [Speaker 0]
very separate, entire... You know, it's a
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:12,344 [Speaker 0]
business, and then the alcohol approval.
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:13,764 [Speaker 0]
So alcohol is where we're still holding
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,544 [Speaker 0]
the CUP, uh, for convenience markets.
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:20,204 [Speaker 7]
Got it. So, so they would- so if a corner
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:23,174 [Speaker 7]
store, bodega-like, um,
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:27,104 [Speaker 7]
establishment wanted to sell some sort of
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:28,294 [Speaker 7]
either liquor or beer-
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:28,394 [Speaker 0]
Mm
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,074 [Speaker 7]
... or wine or whatever, they would still
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:31,244 [Speaker 7]
need to get a CUP?
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:32,394 [Speaker 0]
Yeah, yeah, that's correct, in front of
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:33,514 [Speaker 0]
the Planning Commission.
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:37,464 [Speaker 7]
Do they... Are all, uh, to make sure I'm
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:40,704 [Speaker 7]
understanding, are all establishments that
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:42,084 [Speaker 7]
sell alcohol
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:45,964 [Speaker 7]
required to also get a permit from the
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:47,584 [Speaker 7]
alcoholic beverage-
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:48,164 [Speaker 0]
ABC, yeah.
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:48,524 [Speaker 7]
Yeah.
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:49,324 [Speaker 0]
That's correct.
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:49,694 [Speaker 7]
So there's-
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:51,644 [Speaker 0]
They get their license, and they show that
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,294 [Speaker 0]
when they submit their application.
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,584 [Speaker 7]
So there's still that check at the state
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:58,324 [Speaker 7]
level, regardless of whether or not we
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:00,564 [Speaker 7]
have some sort of CUP versus MUP
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:01,184 [Speaker 7]
restriction?
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:02,594 [Speaker 0]
Right, right. They go through them as
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,104 [Speaker 0]
well.
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:07,154 [Speaker 7]
Okay. And I saw an example of, um, of a
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:10,104 [Speaker 7]
venue that had to get a CUP to
00:26:10,164 --> 00:26:12,944 [Speaker 7]
serve alcohol, was, uh, The Crow, the
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:14,354 [Speaker 7]
comedy, um,
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:15,784 [Speaker 7]
uh,
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:19,384 [Speaker 7]
theater. Is that the right word? Anyway,
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:19,854 [Speaker 7]
uh, w-
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:23,344 [Speaker 7]
so if we were to implement these changes,
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:27,484 [Speaker 7]
would it retroactively, mm, allow those
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,224 [Speaker 7]
uses for the existing ones that had a
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:31,844 [Speaker 7]
CUP, and if they had to move or something
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,154 [Speaker 7]
like that, would it... How would that
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:34,584 [Speaker 7]
work?
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:37,444 [Speaker 0]
It, it wouldn't apply retroactively, but
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:38,884 [Speaker 0]
then they would be able to come through
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:41,064 [Speaker 0]
and apply for this administrative process,
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,104 [Speaker 0]
which, you know, happens very quickly,
00:26:43,224 --> 00:26:45,274 [Speaker 0]
just with staff and then a few weeks. Um,
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,304 [Speaker 0]
as long as they're okay with the
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:47,964 [Speaker 0]
conditions, the standard conditions for
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,164 [Speaker 0]
that use. Um, you know, sometimes the CUP
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:52,884 [Speaker 0]
is a little more flexible because, you
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:54,734 [Speaker 0]
know, they can kinda negotiate the... or
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:56,464 [Speaker 0]
fight for their hours or whatever they're
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,864 [Speaker 0]
looking for. Um, so it really would just
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:01,054 [Speaker 0]
depend on what works best for them, but
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:02,664 [Speaker 0]
they would have to apply again for a new
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,684 [Speaker 0]
AE.
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:06,894 [Speaker 7]
Okay, but we would, we would be able to,
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:09,564 [Speaker 7]
uh, create standards for hours and things
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,894 [Speaker 7]
like that under the MUP that wouldn't,
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,654 [Speaker 7]
mmm, that could, that, that could
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,444 [Speaker 7]
potentially not negatively impact those
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:17,394 [Speaker 7]
types of businesses?
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:17,664 [Speaker 0]
Right.
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,214 [Speaker 7]
Okay. All right. Thank you.
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:20,504 [Speaker 8]
All right,
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:22,864 [Speaker 8]
Council Member Hall.
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,744 [Speaker 9]
Thank you.
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:26,084 [Speaker 8]
Yeah, Council, oh.
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,504 [Speaker 9]
Thank you, Mayor. Um, would you mind
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:28,824 [Speaker 9]
pulling up the policy question slide,
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:30,344 [Speaker 9]
please?
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:35,274 [Speaker 9]
Can you very succinctly state what the
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,284 [Speaker 9]
staff recommendation is for each of these,
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,684 [Speaker 9]
and what the Planning Commission
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:40,704 [Speaker 9]
recommendation is for each of these?
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:43,424 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. So for number one, uh, what is shown
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:45,604 [Speaker 0]
is a Planning Commission recommendation.
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:48,304 [Speaker 0]
So a CUP is required for medium-scale
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:51,244 [Speaker 0]
retail between fifty and eighty thousand.
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,184 [Speaker 0]
Staff recommendation is anything within
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:55,444 [Speaker 0]
that twenty-five to eighty range is either
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,024 [Speaker 0]
an MUP, if it's adjacent to residential,
00:27:58,064 --> 00:28:00,274 [Speaker 0]
or just a PLOP. You know, majority of our
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,174 [Speaker 0]
commercial parcels on the boulevards are
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:03,484 [Speaker 0]
adjacent to residential, so it would
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:05,204 [Speaker 0]
require that. Um,
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,194 [Speaker 0]
and then sec- do you wanna take the other
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:09,664 [Speaker 0]
ones?
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:11,154 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, so question number two, the Planning
00:28:11,224 --> 00:28:13,924 [Speaker 1]
Commission, uh, recommended to maintain
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,164 [Speaker 1]
the current, uh, prohibition on pub
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:18,924 [Speaker 1]
crawls. Uh, question number three, uh, the
00:28:19,024 --> 00:28:20,374 [Speaker 1]
Planning Commission recommended-
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:21,374 [Speaker 9]
Sorry, what's staff re- staff's
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:21,454 [Speaker 9]
recommendation on two?
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:23,744 [Speaker 1]
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, staff recommendation is
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:24,793 [Speaker 1]
to, um,
00:28:25,644 --> 00:28:27,304 [Speaker 1]
to eliminate this-
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:27,314 [Speaker 9]
Okay
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:30,004 [Speaker 1]
... along with all the others. Uh,
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,103 [Speaker 1]
question number three, should the hours be
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:33,584 [Speaker 1]
nine PM? So the Planning Commission
00:28:33,644 --> 00:28:36,024 [Speaker 1]
recommended a closing hour of nine PM, and
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,704 [Speaker 1]
staff is recommending twelve AM to sync
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,124 [Speaker 1]
up with restaurants.
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:40,364 [Speaker 9]
Okay.
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:42,454 [Speaker 1]
Uh, and question number four was not
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:43,684 [Speaker 1]
something that was discussed with the
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:45,924 [Speaker 1]
Planning Commission. This question or this
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:48,004 [Speaker 1]
proposed change evolved after kind of
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:50,324 [Speaker 1]
their discussion in terms of how we can
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:53,404 [Speaker 1]
improve, um, our existing businesses. So
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:56,284 [Speaker 1]
this is, uh, a question just for the
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,124 [Speaker 1]
council.
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:58,384 [Speaker 9]
And does staff have a recommendation on
00:28:58,424 --> 00:28:58,904 [Speaker 9]
number four?
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,134 [Speaker 1]
Uh, yes, we do recommend, uh, allowing for
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,724 [Speaker 1]
bars, uh, to be able to reopen if they're
00:29:03,764 --> 00:29:04,394 [Speaker 1]
closed more than twelve months.
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:04,944 [Speaker 9]
Okay, thank you.
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:08,134 [Speaker 8]
Council Member Negrete.
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,564 [Speaker 7]
Um, okay, trying to keep things brief to
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,444 [Speaker 7]
move it along. I just had two questions.
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:17,974 [Speaker 7]
Um, are barsicles, I was just asking, and
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,464 [Speaker 7]
I wanted to ask out loud. We used to have
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,844 [Speaker 7]
a barsicle that was on Main Street, and
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,464 [Speaker 7]
you could only drink on the actual... It's
00:29:24,504 --> 00:29:26,444 [Speaker 7]
like a people pedaling. It's like a big
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,014 [Speaker 7]
bike. Um,
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,224 [Speaker 7]
so I was just curious, like, how that fits
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,804 [Speaker 7]
into this, and then maybe related and
00:29:30,864 --> 00:29:34,584 [Speaker 7]
second to that, is, um, cart- the question
00:29:34,624 --> 00:29:36,124 [Speaker 7]
has been asked many times about bringing
00:29:36,144 --> 00:29:38,964 [Speaker 7]
it back, and then carts on the promenade,
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,864 [Speaker 7]
like, if an already established
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:43,054 [Speaker 7]
establishment can have, like, sort of
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:44,944 [Speaker 7]
outdoor cart, like seasonally or
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:45,644 [Speaker 7]
something?
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:46,644 [Speaker 8]
Yeah, yeah.
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:49,224 [Speaker 8]
Um, so on the cart issue, actually, that's
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:52,314 [Speaker 8]
what, um, Cabo Cantina does right now.
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:52,354 [Speaker 7]
Yeah.
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:53,044 [Speaker 8]
You know, they serve direct-
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:53,074 [Speaker 7]
Yeah
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,064 [Speaker 8]
... to the sidewalk. Um, and we facilitate
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,164 [Speaker 8]
that. That's allowed because of the
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:57,444 [Speaker 8]
entertainment zone. You can have open
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:58,964 [Speaker 8]
containers straight into the public right
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:00,834 [Speaker 8]
of way. It was actually a very creative,
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:03,004 [Speaker 8]
um, idea, and the, uh, license agreement
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,604 [Speaker 8]
was updated for that. Um, we have heard
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:08,024 [Speaker 8]
interest in kind of like a mobile beverage
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:10,904 [Speaker 8]
cart, uh, idea, um, you know, that we're,
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,454 [Speaker 8]
we're looking at. Um, someone had, had
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,274 [Speaker 8]
proposed that, but that's certainly a-
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:17,034 [Speaker 8]
allowed. Um, and it also allows, uh, uh,
00:30:17,224 --> 00:30:19,344 [Speaker 8]
DTSM also, um, on the promenade, for
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,944 [Speaker 8]
example, to put, um, uh, kind of like
00:30:22,024 --> 00:30:24,104 [Speaker 8]
brand activation, you know, with alcohol
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:25,464 [Speaker 8]
service. So sort of like that pop-up
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:27,204 [Speaker 8]
experience as part of the entertainment
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,924 [Speaker 8]
zone. Um, so that's typically where we see
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:31,704 [Speaker 8]
that kind of like-... you know, mobile
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:34,264 [Speaker 8]
beverage cart, um, kind of experience. On
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:35,784 [Speaker 8]
the barcycle, that is an interesting
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,164 [Speaker 8]
thing. I, I wanna say that it's
00:30:38,944 --> 00:30:39,334 [Speaker 8]
like, yes-
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:40,504 [Speaker 10]
We had it. I've experienced it.
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,344 [Speaker 8]
Yes. No, no, we have one. We haven't-- we
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:44,004 [Speaker 8]
don't have one operating right now. I
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:44,364 [Speaker 8]
think we-
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:44,874 [Speaker 10]
No, they, I don't-
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:44,874 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,294 [Speaker 10]
They stopped years ago, and-
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,414 [Speaker 8]
Yeah. I don't know if it was, like,
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:49,394 [Speaker 8]
liability reasons or something, but-
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:50,904 [Speaker 10]
But they said years ago there was some
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:51,284 [Speaker 10]
issue-
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:51,334 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:51,904 [Speaker 10]
... 'cause it was on-
00:30:51,924 --> 00:30:51,934 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:52,764 [Speaker 10]
... Main Street.
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,124 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:53,824 [Speaker 10]
Um-
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:54,524 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:55,544 [Speaker 10]
Let's bring it back.
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:55,694 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:55,924 [Speaker 10]
Um,
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,554 [Speaker 10]
what about pedicabs? Sorry, maybe we're
00:30:58,584 --> 00:30:59,274 [Speaker 10]
taking it too far.
00:30:59,684 --> 00:30:59,704 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:00,044 [Speaker 10]
Um,
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,524 [Speaker 10]
can I just, 'cause since I'm the last
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,934 [Speaker 10]
questions, can I just say my comments and
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:04,953 [Speaker 10]
then go back, so I don't have to go back
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:06,394 [Speaker 10]
in the queue, or do you have any?
00:31:06,394 --> 00:31:07,184 [Speaker 6]
Sure, I have one. I have one.
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:08,384 [Speaker 10]
Oh, sorry, we have public comment.
00:31:08,394 --> 00:31:08,394 [Speaker 6]
Yeah.
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:10,984 [Speaker 10]
Okay, so to... We're not really sure about
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:12,784 [Speaker 10]
barcycles.
00:31:13,744 --> 00:31:16,944 [Speaker 10]
And carts are directly attached to an
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:18,784 [Speaker 10]
already established establishment, right?
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:20,704 [Speaker 10]
Not... I just wanna make sure people can't
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:22,004 [Speaker 10]
just come in and set up a cart, 'cause
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:23,544 [Speaker 10]
then it takes away from the existing
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:24,624 [Speaker 10]
businesses.
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:25,134 [Speaker 4]
Yeah.
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:25,804 [Speaker 6]
Yeah.
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:26,804 [Speaker 8]
Yeah, I, I, I was referring to the
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:27,904 [Speaker 8]
entertainment zone as part of, like, an
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:30,224 [Speaker 8]
event activation or something. Yeah, yeah.
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:31,404 [Speaker 10]
But when it, when it's an event
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:33,004 [Speaker 10]
activation, it's still attached to an
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:34,204 [Speaker 10]
establishment that has their liquor?
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:36,224 [Speaker 8]
Not necessarily, no. It could be a third
00:31:36,234 --> 00:31:36,334 [Speaker 8]
party.
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,244 [Speaker 10]
That's, that's one thing that's a little
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:37,944 [Speaker 10]
interesting-
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:38,084 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:39,644 [Speaker 10]
... I'd like to explore, is protecting the
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,664 [Speaker 10]
existing businesses who already pay all
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,504 [Speaker 10]
the taxes and have already gone through
00:31:43,544 --> 00:31:45,684 [Speaker 10]
all the things before we made it easier to
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:47,404 [Speaker 10]
be able to sell alcohol and serve the
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:48,204 [Speaker 10]
community.
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:48,314 [Speaker 8]
Yeah.
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:50,254 [Speaker 10]
And then someone comes in for an event and
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,854 [Speaker 10]
takes that opportunity-
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:51,954 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:53,224 [Speaker 10]
... to get that foot traffic.
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:54,614 [Speaker 8]
So to the extent it's on the public right
00:31:54,644 --> 00:31:56,094 [Speaker 8]
of way, you know, that's gonna be really
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,294 [Speaker 8]
the city's proprietary capacity, right?
00:31:58,324 --> 00:31:59,324 [Speaker 8]
That's not really, like, a land use
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,514 [Speaker 8]
regulation, you know, in terms of, um, uh,
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:03,524 [Speaker 8]
you know, whether it's connected with a
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,154 [Speaker 8]
local business or what have you. That's,
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:08,234 [Speaker 8]
that's hard to do in a zoning code, uh,
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,504 [Speaker 8]
per se, unless it's like right on private
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:10,954 [Speaker 8]
property. Typically, you're talking about
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,414 [Speaker 8]
something, again, in the public right of
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:12,904 [Speaker 8]
way.
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,854 [Speaker 10]
So if on the promenade, for example, this
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:15,754 [Speaker 10]
would have to be something that's
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:17,684 [Speaker 10]
discussed maybe within downtown Santa
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:17,774 [Speaker 10]
Monica-
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:18,644 [Speaker 8]
Yeah, exactly
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:20,004 [Speaker 10]
... for example, where when they do those-
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:21,594 [Speaker 8]
Or within our event permits or things like
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:21,834 [Speaker 8]
that.
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:22,784 [Speaker 10]
Dance crews, that they have to make an
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,444 [Speaker 10]
arrangement that you don't take away from
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:24,524 [Speaker 10]
the-
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:24,634 [Speaker 8]
Mm-hmm
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:25,664 [Speaker 10]
... existing businesses?
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,864 [Speaker 4]
Well, and I think it could also be part of
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,624 [Speaker 4]
the entertainment zones management plan
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:30,304 [Speaker 4]
as well.
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:30,474 [Speaker 8]
Yep, yep.
00:32:30,524 --> 00:32:31,314 [Speaker 4]
So, um-
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:31,314 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:32,884 [Speaker 4]
... which is something that you delegated
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:36,104 [Speaker 4]
authority to staff to, um, uh, promulgate-
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:36,114 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:37,924 [Speaker 4]
... as part of the entertainment zone. But
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,224 [Speaker 4]
it, it... You know, should council wanna
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:40,824 [Speaker 4]
give direction on that at another time,
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:42,634 [Speaker 4]
it's not before you this evening, but that
00:32:42,644 --> 00:32:43,674 [Speaker 4]
could be discussed as part of the
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:44,924 [Speaker 4]
entertainment zone as well.
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:45,964 [Speaker 10]
Okay, thank you.
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:50,524 [Speaker 6]
Great. I just have one question. Um, since
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:52,104 [Speaker 6]
there seems to be a lot of, uh,
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,644 [Speaker 6]
differentiation on the alcohol, uh, issue
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:56,064 [Speaker 6]
between what the planning commission
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:57,644 [Speaker 6]
recommendation is and what the staff
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:59,344 [Speaker 6]
report, staff's recommendation is, and
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:01,824 [Speaker 6]
we've had some discussion on it, um, can
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,264 [Speaker 6]
you tell us about how the proposed alcohol
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:05,564 [Speaker 6]
thresholds for
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,464 [Speaker 6]
CUPs, et cetera, um,
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:11,364 [Speaker 6]
compared to other jurisdictions that we
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:14,044 [Speaker 6]
might be competing with for new business
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:16,464 [Speaker 6]
activity, i.e., like smaller cities like
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:18,284 [Speaker 6]
Pasadena, Culver City, West Hollywood,
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:20,534 [Speaker 6]
Long Beach? Um, because I think it is
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:23,364 [Speaker 6]
really important as we're looking at where
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,524 [Speaker 6]
businesses might try to locate, you know,
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,104 [Speaker 6]
we wanna make- be as business-friendly as
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:30,184 [Speaker 6]
possible. That's the goal here. How do we
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,964 [Speaker 6]
compare to other jurisdictions? And I do
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:33,404 [Speaker 6]
believe that that was answered earlier
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,484 [Speaker 6]
today, so hopefully, you have that
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:35,474 [Speaker 6]
information.
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:37,504 [Speaker 8]
Yeah, so I think we looked at retail, and
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:39,974 [Speaker 8]
we got generally information for the, uh-
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:40,174 [Speaker 6]
Alcohol
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:41,964 [Speaker 8]
... West Hollywood, Pasadena. So there is
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,764 [Speaker 8]
an administrative option available, um,
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:49,984 [Speaker 8]
for some eligible restaurants, um, and,
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:51,904 [Speaker 8]
uh, retailers. So it may
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:53,444 [Speaker 8]
be similar to our program. I think we
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:55,524 [Speaker 8]
were-- we didn't have all the information,
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:56,804 [Speaker 8]
you know, in front of us. I think we were
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:58,704 [Speaker 8]
just starting to do some of that
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,384 [Speaker 8]
research. Um, I will say,
00:34:01,064 --> 00:34:02,833 [Speaker 8]
we have had overwhelmingly positive
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:05,564 [Speaker 8]
feedback on our alcohol exemption program,
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,224 [Speaker 8]
um, within the downtown, and now it's
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:10,764 [Speaker 8]
expanded, proposed to be the entire, uh,
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:13,053 [Speaker 8]
downtown for a variety of uses. Um,
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,894 [Speaker 8]
restaurants and recent- I looked since,
00:34:14,924 --> 00:34:16,244 [Speaker 8]
you know, we made this switch, and there's
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:19,304 [Speaker 8]
probably been over a hundred, uh, permits
00:34:19,364 --> 00:34:20,434 [Speaker 8]
issued for-
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:20,494 [Speaker 6]
Wow
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,894 [Speaker 8]
... alcohol exemption. The people that
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:22,994 [Speaker 8]
have switched over-
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:23,344 [Speaker 6]
Wow
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:24,833 [Speaker 8]
... from CUPs are like: "We love this
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,644 [Speaker 8]
better," you know? And it's like, if you
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:28,004 [Speaker 8]
have everything you need, we can approve
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,064 [Speaker 8]
it in a matter of days, which is, um,
00:34:31,124 --> 00:34:31,524 [Speaker 8]
super-
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:32,264 [Speaker 6]
Everyone listening
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:32,553 [Speaker 8]
... different.
00:34:32,584 --> 00:34:33,004 [Speaker 6]
Hello.
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:35,764 [Speaker 8]
Yeah. It's pretty different than, I think,
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,934 [Speaker 8]
our peer cities at the speed at which...
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:39,644 [Speaker 8]
and the ease. Um, it's just, like, one
00:34:39,764 --> 00:34:42,324 [Speaker 8]
form. You sign and date it, staff reviews
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:44,244 [Speaker 8]
it, and if it looks fine, it's fine. Um,
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,204 [Speaker 8]
you know, we, we try to make it easy and
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:48,724 [Speaker 8]
common sense. So, um, I think it's been
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:50,164 [Speaker 8]
wildly successful. You know, we hear
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:51,074 [Speaker 8]
really good feedback about it.
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:52,664 [Speaker 6]
Well, I appreciate that you all understood
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:54,163 [Speaker 6]
the assignment, and you're coming to us
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:55,444 [Speaker 6]
with the recommendations that are gonna
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,384 [Speaker 6]
make it easiest to do business here. So
00:34:57,504 --> 00:34:59,044 [Speaker 6]
really appreciate that. I think, um, I
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:00,324 [Speaker 6]
don't see any more- Oh, Snell has
00:35:00,384 --> 00:35:00,514 [Speaker 6]
questions.
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,124 [Speaker 11]
Just one quick question. And since that,
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:05,144 [Speaker 11]
uh, you may not be able to answer it, but
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,904 [Speaker 11]
can you kind of tell us, um,
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:10,244 [Speaker 11]
what type of, um,
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:13,904 [Speaker 11]
w- what the effect has been with our
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,544 [Speaker 11]
police department, and, you know-
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:15,724 [Speaker 8]
Mm
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:16,784 [Speaker 11]
... how many instances-
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:16,814 [Speaker 8]
Yeah
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,724 [Speaker 11]
... have we had because of that?
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:19,444 [Speaker 8]
I mean, I think
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,564 [Speaker 8]
not something we've looked at, but I think
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:23,144 [Speaker 8]
if, if, if something, if, if a business
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,184 [Speaker 8]
was a problem, we would certainly be aware
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,624 [Speaker 8]
of it, you know, whether through law
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:30,184 [Speaker 8]
enforcement, code enforcement. Um, with
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:32,314 [Speaker 8]
alcohol exemptions, these are typically,
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,504 [Speaker 8]
um, it's like a ancillary. It's a beverage
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:36,044 [Speaker 8]
service ancillary to something else. It's
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:38,024 [Speaker 8]
a restaurant. These are, like, low-risk
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:41,584 [Speaker 8]
issues, even within, um, the promenade,
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:43,104 [Speaker 8]
right? Where you can open a bar with an
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:45,824 [Speaker 8]
alcohol exemption. I mean, the fact is,
00:35:45,864 --> 00:35:48,264 [Speaker 8]
they, they have a vested interest in, you
00:35:48,304 --> 00:35:50,604 [Speaker 8]
know, behaving well, being, being good
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:53,514 [Speaker 8]
neighbors. It- we, we, we've not seen it
00:35:53,544 --> 00:35:54,984 [Speaker 8]
being an issue, you know, other than the
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:57,184 [Speaker 8]
sort of, I think, like, typical, you know,
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:59,144 [Speaker 8]
drunk and disorderlies, as, as may happen
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,544 [Speaker 8]
with any alcohol service, but it has not
00:36:01,584 --> 00:36:04,024 [Speaker 8]
been a prevalent issue. Um, even during
00:36:04,084 --> 00:36:06,884 [Speaker 8]
COVID, you know, when we had, um, alcohol
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,473 [Speaker 8]
service, you know, that may have extended,
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:11,664 [Speaker 8]
like, to, um, an private, uh, parking
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:12,984 [Speaker 8]
lot, right, right next to someone's
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,564 [Speaker 8]
backyard. I think we had, like, one, one
00:36:15,654 --> 00:36:18,034 [Speaker 8]
issue, one business that was an issue, and
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:20,473 [Speaker 8]
it was dealt with. So it just overall
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:22,964 [Speaker 8]
hasn't been, you know, this, this massive
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:25,464 [Speaker 8]
problem, um, in terms of streamlining the
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,304 [Speaker 8]
process.
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,740 [Speaker 0]
... Thank you.
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,560 [Speaker 6]
Amazing. Oh, you, would you like to say
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,070 [Speaker 6]
something?
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,210 [Speaker 0]
Oh, yeah. Just to touch on that too, all
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,670 [Speaker 0]
alco- alcohol applications require a
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,160 [Speaker 0]
security plan approved by the police
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,270 [Speaker 0]
department, and that has to be provided
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880 [Speaker 0]
with the application, so that's already
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,370 [Speaker 0]
done before it even comes to us. So that's
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,020 [Speaker 0]
another check that happens.
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:45,390 [Speaker 6]
Great, so the sky is not falling. Um,
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,380 [Speaker 6]
okay, we have three comments for 12B:
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,490 [Speaker 6]
Michael Klass, Luke Kane, Will Klass. I
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,800 [Speaker 6]
appreciate you guys staying here for so
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,860 [Speaker 6]
long. Thank you.
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,690 [Speaker 12]
Good evening, Mayor, Council Members, and
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,140 [Speaker 12]
Mr. City Manager. My name is Michael
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,140 [Speaker 12]
Klass. My brother Willie and I own Santa
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,420 [Speaker 12]
Monica Jewelry and Loan, the city's only
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,800 [Speaker 12]
remaining pawn shop. We are deeply
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,720 [Speaker 12]
invested in this community. I live in
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,500 [Speaker 12]
Santa Monica with my wife and three young
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,380 [Speaker 12]
children. This is home. The amendment we
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,560 [Speaker 12]
are talking about does not expand pawnshop
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,260 [Speaker 12]
uses. It does not open the door to
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,070 [Speaker 12]
anything beyond what the city has already
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,780 [Speaker 12]
allowed for the past seventy-five years.
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,620 [Speaker 12]
The only purpose of this amendment is to
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,790 [Speaker 12]
correct a documented error made in the two
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,590 [Speaker 12]
thousand and seventeen Downtown Community
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,380 [Speaker 12]
Plan, an error acknowledged by planning
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,040 [Speaker 12]
staff themselves. Just so you know, there
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,240 [Speaker 12]
were originally four pawnshop licenses
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,900 [Speaker 12]
given out in the city of Santa Monica. We
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,440 [Speaker 12]
are the only pawnshop left. That mistake
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,040 [Speaker 12]
stripped away relocation rights that have
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,520 [Speaker 12]
been in existence for seventy-five years.
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,280 [Speaker 12]
No one informed us about the change in the
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,980 [Speaker 12]
DCP when it happened. We were not at the
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,920 [Speaker 12]
last council meeting when it was discussed
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400 [Speaker 12]
because we were told it was gonna be a
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,880 [Speaker 12]
simple fix. That wasn't the case. We also
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,730 [Speaker 12]
presented this situation to the Planning
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,300 [Speaker 12]
Commission. They voted unanimously for the
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,060 [Speaker 12]
staff to correct the error and allow the
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,690 [Speaker 12]
relocation that was established years ago,
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,960 [Speaker 12]
which is in your staff report. That
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,130 [Speaker 12]
clerical oversight is preventing us from
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480 [Speaker 12]
relocating to a safer, most-- more
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,760 [Speaker 12]
suitable downtown, uh, space in downtown,
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,280 [Speaker 12]
something we've done before with full city
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,670 [Speaker 12]
support. We purchased this business in
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,720 [Speaker 12]
two thousand and nine, and it has been
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,340 [Speaker 12]
operated in good standing for over
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,070 [Speaker 12]
forty-five years. We contribute nearly
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,669 [Speaker 12]
twenty-- we contribute twenty thousand
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,700 [Speaker 12]
dollars annually in license fees and pay
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,420 [Speaker 12]
six figures in sales tax. We serve
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,300 [Speaker 12]
thousands of residents who rely on safe,
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,760 [Speaker 12]
regulated, non-recourse loans, a service
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,060 [Speaker 12]
no other business in the city provides.
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,880 [Speaker 12]
Approving this amendment does not create
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,460 [Speaker 12]
risk. It prevents unintended harm. It
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,660 [Speaker 12]
restores the city's long-standing policy.
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,480 [Speaker 12]
I respectfully ask you to correct the
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,040 [Speaker 12]
error, restore the rights the city already
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,820 [Speaker 12]
granted, and allow Sa-
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,860 [Speaker 6]
Thank you. Um, Luke Kane.
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,080 [Speaker 13]
Good evening again, Mayor and Council
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,180 [Speaker 13]
Members. Um, I'm here tonight, uh, again,
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,410 [Speaker 13]
to discuss a matter of basic fairness and
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,250 [Speaker 13]
the survival of a long-standing local
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,120 [Speaker 13]
family business. Just a little history,
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,860 [Speaker 13]
for seventy-five years, pawnshops have
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,560 [Speaker 13]
been allowed in the city of Santa Monica
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,840 [Speaker 13]
but were limited to the area of Second,
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,420 [Speaker 13]
Third, and Fourth Street between Wilshire
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,130 [Speaker 13]
and Broadway. Angelo's Pawn Shop was the
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,240 [Speaker 13]
last remaining pawn shop in Santa Monica,
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,930 [Speaker 13]
uh, which was purchased by Michael and
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,840 [Speaker 13]
William Klass.
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,880 [Speaker 13]
Angelo's original location was on Second
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,150 [Speaker 13]
and Santa Monica Boulevard. He was forced
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,660 [Speaker 13]
to move because that building was being
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,080 [Speaker 13]
torn down. Finding a new location was
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,580 [Speaker 13]
difficult. Once Mayor Genzer and the City
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,980 [Speaker 13]
Council became aware of the difficulty,
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,340 [Speaker 13]
the City Council created a text amendment
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,340 [Speaker 13]
to allow pawnshops to operate in what the
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,750 [Speaker 13]
city deemed was downtown Santa Monica,
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,620 [Speaker 13]
excluding Ocean Avenue. This allowed the
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,580 [Speaker 13]
pawnshops to relocate within the borders
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,960 [Speaker 13]
of the newly designated downtown. The
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,510 [Speaker 13]
first new home of the pawn shop was in
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,210 [Speaker 13]
this-- was in a city-owned property on
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,800 [Speaker 13]
Fifth Street, just off Santa Monica
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,180 [Speaker 13]
Boulevard. After a few years, that
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,640 [Speaker 13]
building was torn down. Around that time,
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,580 [Speaker 13]
Angelo's Pawn Shop then became Santa
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,920 [Speaker 13]
Monica Jewelry and Loan. Being forced to
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400 [Speaker 13]
move again, they moved to four oh eight
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,960 [Speaker 13]
Broadway, where they have operated for
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,020 [Speaker 13]
almost fifteen years. Santa Monica Jewelry
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,169 [Speaker 13]
and Loan is the only pawn shop left in
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,160 [Speaker 13]
the city of Santa Monica. They are heavily
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,850 [Speaker 13]
regulated and fully compliant. This
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,660 [Speaker 13]
amendment simply corrects a documented
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,210 [Speaker 13]
oversight admitted by the Planning
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,060 [Speaker 13]
Department regarding the twenty seventeen
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,910 [Speaker 13]
DCP. It does not allow for new pawn shops;
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,220 [Speaker 13]
it merely restores the re- relocation
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,450 [Speaker 13]
rights the city has upheld for decades.
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,429 [Speaker 13]
Denying this correction due to a clerical
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,060 [Speaker 13]
error could force out a long-standing
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,480 [Speaker 13]
family-run business. Blocking their
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,470 [Speaker 13]
ability to relocate was an error. It is
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,980 [Speaker 13]
not a policy. It is an unintended
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,790 [Speaker 13]
consequence that harms a long-standing,
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,790 [Speaker 13]
compliant, local family-run business. This
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,800 [Speaker 13]
amendment simply corrects that mistake,
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800 [Speaker 13]
nothing more. I urge you to approve the
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,510 [Speaker 13]
amendment. Thank you so much for your
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,660 [Speaker 13]
consideration.
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,420 [Speaker 6]
Thank you, Mr. Kane. Um, Will Klass.
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,680 [Speaker 14]
Good evening, Mayor and Council Members.
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,060 [Speaker 14]
My name is Will Klass. My brother Michael
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,580 [Speaker 14]
and I own Santa Monica Jewelry and Loan,
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,760 [Speaker 14]
and we are raising our families here, six
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,520 [Speaker 14]
kids between us. This city isn't just
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,480 [Speaker 14]
where we work, it's where our children are
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,280 [Speaker 14]
growing up. It's our home. For decades,
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,260 [Speaker 14]
this family business has served this
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,520 [Speaker 14]
community. We purchased the business in
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,809 [Speaker 14]
two thousand and nine. We followed every
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,260 [Speaker 14]
rule, paid every fee, and relocated
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,480 [Speaker 14]
whenever necessary.
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,360 [Speaker 14]
We've done everything right, and yet
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,700 [Speaker 14]
today, because of a clerical mistake made
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,680 [Speaker 14]
in twenty seventeen, a mistake the
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,940 [Speaker 14]
Planning Department acknowledged, our
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,160 [Speaker 14]
entire livelihood is suddenly at risk. We
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,530 [Speaker 14]
were never told about this error. We only
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,290 [Speaker 14]
discovered it when we started asking
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,480 [Speaker 14]
questions because we are looking to move.
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,250 [Speaker 14]
Now, a business that has been part of
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,080 [Speaker 14]
Santa Monica for generations could be shut
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,180 [Speaker 14]
down over something we had nothing to do
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,340 [Speaker 14]
with. That is not how a city should treat
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,560 [Speaker 14]
a family business that has played by the
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,660 [Speaker 14]
rules. That is not how you treat a
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,360 [Speaker 14]
business that has stood with this
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,600 [Speaker 14]
community for forty-five years. This
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,420 [Speaker 14]
amendment does not bring in new pawn
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,250 [Speaker 14]
shops. It simply restores the relocation
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,840 [Speaker 14]
rights of an existing business the city
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,439 [Speaker 14]
had already granted, rights we've relied
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,260 [Speaker 14]
on in good faith. If this isn't corrected,
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,140 [Speaker 14]
our employees lose their jobs, our
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,100 [Speaker 14]
families are harmed, and thousands of
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,710 [Speaker 14]
residents lose a service they depend on.
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,022 [Speaker 14]
I'm asking you to fix the mistake....
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:43,152 [Speaker 14]
Restore the right to relocate in the
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,532 [Speaker 14]
limited area that was set up forty-five
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:47,732 [Speaker 14]
years ago and reestablish with Mayor
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,852 [Speaker 14]
Genzer's Coun- Council, and let us keep
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:54,912 [Speaker 14]
serving the city we love. Thank you.
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,202 [Speaker 6]
Thank you. Um, so that concludes the
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:58,762 [Speaker 6]
public comments, as we don't have any on
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:01,332 [Speaker 6]
the phone. Uh- We do have one person on
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:02,572 [Speaker 6]
the phone. Oh, I thought she wasn't here.
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,772 [Speaker 6]
Okay. So it's Jacob Wasserman. Oh, my
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:08,152 [Speaker 6]
apologies. Jacob Wasserman.
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:16,112 [Speaker 6]
Mr. Wasserman, are you there?
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,372 [Speaker 6]
Go ahead, you can start.
00:43:21,372 --> 00:43:24,592 [Speaker 15]
Oh, yes, thank you so much. Um, hi, I'm
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:26,162 [Speaker 15]
Jacob Wasserman again, um,
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:29,162 [Speaker 15]
Wilmot resident planning commissioner. Um,
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:30,612 [Speaker 15]
I'm not speaking on behalf of the whole
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:32,212 [Speaker 15]
Planning Commission, but I will speak with
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:34,852 [Speaker 15]
my planning commissioner hat on. Um, this
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,392 [Speaker 15]
is a great ordinance. Um, I'm so thankful
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:40,142 [Speaker 15]
for the work the staff has done. One
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:41,932 [Speaker 15]
thing you might know, we actually
00:43:41,972 --> 00:43:43,342 [Speaker 15]
discovered this during the Planning
00:43:43,352 --> 00:43:46,352 [Speaker 15]
Commission hearing, midnight mass, um,
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,282 [Speaker 15]
late night Simchat Torah, or any other
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:50,412 [Speaker 15]
religious event that goes into the night,
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,552 [Speaker 15]
is currently illegal in Santa Monica if
00:43:52,592 --> 00:43:55,082 [Speaker 15]
you actually enforce the rules. Um, this
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:57,472 [Speaker 15]
ordinance would correct that. Um, so
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:58,792 [Speaker 15]
there's a lot of good stuff in here. I
00:43:58,832 --> 00:44:00,522 [Speaker 15]
think staff has gone over it well. I, I
00:44:00,552 --> 00:44:03,592 [Speaker 15]
just wanted to clarify, um, two things.
00:44:03,632 --> 00:44:06,252 [Speaker 15]
One is that the staff report talks about
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:09,632 [Speaker 15]
certain restrictions only applying on Main
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:12,112 [Speaker 15]
and Montana. Um, we had made a motion
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:14,892 [Speaker 15]
that we are fine deferring to staff on
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:17,152 [Speaker 15]
what they think is right, but that it
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:19,252 [Speaker 15]
shouldn't call out specific streets, you
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:21,702 [Speaker 15]
know, if we have zones for a reason. Um,
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:23,372 [Speaker 15]
and then second, with regards to the pub
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:25,932 [Speaker 15]
crawls, um, as I understood what we
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:28,012 [Speaker 15]
decided, we were recommending that pub
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:31,532 [Speaker 15]
crawls be allowed, um, by right with an
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:35,212 [Speaker 15]
alcohol license downtown, um, but need a
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,832 [Speaker 15]
CUP outside of downtown, um, split the
00:44:37,872 --> 00:44:39,912 [Speaker 15]
difference. Personally, I would be fine
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:41,732 [Speaker 15]
with them everywhere, but just so the
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:43,982 [Speaker 15]
record is clear, that is my understanding
00:44:43,992 --> 00:44:45,862 [Speaker 15]
of what Planning Commission recommended.
00:44:45,992 --> 00:44:50,391 [Speaker 15]
Um, downtown allowed, outside downtown a
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,512 [Speaker 15]
CUP. But otherwise, this is a great
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:54,382 [Speaker 15]
ordinance. I'm, I'm so glad staff has
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:56,492 [Speaker 15]
proposed it. I think it'll help revitalize
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:58,472 [Speaker 15]
business, both downtown and across the
00:44:58,512 --> 00:44:59,772 [Speaker 15]
city. Thanks so much.
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,360 [Speaker 0]
Thank you, Mr. Wasserman. Um, Council
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,240 [Speaker 0]
Member Magrette?
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,040 [Speaker 1]
One comment.
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,140 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,670 [Speaker 1]
Well, I wanna--
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,840 [Speaker 1]
first I would like to move this item.
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,460 [Speaker 0]
Great.
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,640 [Speaker 1]
Um, because it's getting late. And I'll
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,080 [Speaker 1]
just quickly say, um-
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,700 [Speaker 0]
You wanna answer those policy questions?
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,779 [Speaker 1]
Yes. So question one: Um, should a CUP be
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400 [Speaker 1]
required for medium scale retail,
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,410 [Speaker 1]
twenty-five to eighty square feet, um,
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,960 [Speaker 1]
proposed greater than fifty? Um,
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,060 [Speaker 1]
I'm sorry. I'm just looking at that
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,740 [Speaker 1]
question, and I'm looking at it from the
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,620 [Speaker 1]
twenty-five to eighty. So we're saying it
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,900 [Speaker 1]
would be required for any medium scale
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,919 [Speaker 1]
retail
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,520 [Speaker 1]
above fifty-
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:41,530 [Speaker 2]
Maybe-
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,160 [Speaker 1]
-thousand square feet, correct?
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,930 [Speaker 2]
This is a little more helpful here.
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,580 [Speaker 1]
Sorry, 'cause you have the, both numbers
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,690 [Speaker 1]
in there.
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,200 [Speaker 2]
Yeah. So it's-- we didn't change the
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,810 [Speaker 2]
threshold of medium, so it's still
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,380 [Speaker 2]
twenty-five to eighty. It's just within
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,720 [Speaker 2]
that medium. If you go from fifty to
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,900 [Speaker 2]
eighty, that's when the CUP would kick in.
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,200 [Speaker 1]
So then technically, you don't need it
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,440 [Speaker 1]
from twenty-five to fifty?
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,340 [Speaker 2]
Correct. That would be an MUP
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,180 [Speaker 2]
for that instance. Um, and that's the
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,220 [Speaker 2]
Planning Commission recommendation.
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,440 [Speaker 1]
Um, okay, I'm gonna s- s- so... Okay,
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,200 [Speaker 1]
fifty to eighty under both options, retail
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840 [Speaker 1]
between twenty-five is more flexible, no
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,840 [Speaker 1]
charge. So
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,880 [Speaker 1]
I was gonna leave that at yes. Sorry. Um,
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,040 [Speaker 1]
and then if you could go to the other
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,240 [Speaker 1]
questions.
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,540 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, so the pub crawl, I, I don't
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,180 [Speaker 1]
understand. I was also agreeing with the,
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,860 [Speaker 1]
um, speaker on the phone, that I thought
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,640 [Speaker 1]
it was going to be, um, allowed, but just
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,430 [Speaker 1]
not outside of the entertainment zone. Um,
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,140 [Speaker 1]
so
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,440 [Speaker 1]
I, I, I'm, I think we should allow the pub
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,900 [Speaker 1]
crawls. It feels like it's already sort
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,420 [Speaker 1]
of-- That's sort of the idea of the
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,960 [Speaker 1]
entertainment zone. Um, and then the next
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,660 [Speaker 1]
question.
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,400 [Speaker 1]
Um, yes, staff recommendation, yes. Number
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,420 [Speaker 1]
four is
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,390 [Speaker 1]
bringing back... Yes, that should have
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,690 [Speaker 1]
happened a long time ago.
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,800 [Speaker 1]
And
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,460 [Speaker 1]
number five, is there a fifth question?
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:08,930 [Speaker 2]
No, that's it.
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,160 [Speaker 1]
Okay.
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,259 [Speaker 2]
Just these four.
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280 [Speaker 0]
Can I make a friendly amendment?
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,730 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, we-- I'm just making sure. I just
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,780 [Speaker 1]
wanted to go through, 'cause the square
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,460 [Speaker 1]
footage one was a little confusing to me.
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,580 [Speaker 1]
So, um, so moving yes on questions one
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,600 [Speaker 1]
through four, um, just quickly commenting
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,300 [Speaker 1]
that taking into account some of the other
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,820 [Speaker 1]
stuff that we talked about looking at,
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,300 [Speaker 1]
and for me, the biggest thing is, like,
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,140 [Speaker 1]
making sure, I guess, it- I guess it's not
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,720 [Speaker 1]
in here, but that we're protecting the
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,400 [Speaker 1]
existing businesses. Like, we don't wanna
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,440 [Speaker 1]
take away from those that have gone
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,420 [Speaker 1]
through the effort of establishing a
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,020 [Speaker 1]
business, and then having others come in
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,760 [Speaker 1]
to be able to offer and sell, uh, alcohol
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,860 [Speaker 1]
without utilizing them. So I'd like to
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,160 [Speaker 1]
move, um, twelve B with the staff
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,530 [Speaker 1]
recommendations or the questions answering
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,920 [Speaker 1]
yes to questions one through four.
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,180 [Speaker 3]
Sorry, just to clarify, um, 'cause I
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,700 [Speaker 3]
wasn't tracking exactly what yes versus no
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,680 [Speaker 3]
was on all these, but
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,260 [Speaker 3]
the-- we're moving the staff
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,880 [Speaker 3]
recommendation-
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:03,980 [Speaker 1]
Yes, yeah
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,440 [Speaker 3]
-for all the policy questions, and not the
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,020 [Speaker 3]
PC recommendation? Okay.
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,440 [Speaker 1]
Exactly.
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,700 [Speaker 3]
Thank you.
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,470 [Speaker 4]
And one, one other minor, um,
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,940 [Speaker 4]
clarification is: Staff, um, read some
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,780 [Speaker 4]
changes into the record related to the RR
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,340 [Speaker 4]
and R as well. Just wanted to make clear
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,280 [Speaker 4]
that that would be part of your
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,070 [Speaker 4]
recommendation recall.
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,650 [Speaker 1]
Resolution?
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:19,890 [Speaker 4]
Yes.
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,650 [Speaker 1]
Yeah.
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,520 [Speaker 2]
Just, just for clarity, though, the, the
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,740 [Speaker 2]
staff recommended to remove the CUP in
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,740 [Speaker 2]
question one, whereas I think you were
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,680 [Speaker 2]
saying to keep it. Right. Yes, this-
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,560 [Speaker 3]
That's why I was asking.
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:29,840 [Speaker 2]
Yeah.
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,100 [Speaker 1]
Oh, sorry. Well, I guess I was, I was
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,540 [Speaker 1]
saying-
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,800 [Speaker 0]
We wanna maintain the medium at
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,340 [Speaker 0]
twenty-five to eighty.
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,620 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, so staff would allow more of a
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,020 [Speaker 2]
flexible process for anything from
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,840 [Speaker 2]
twenty-five to eighty, um, just the MUP
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,950 [Speaker 2]
process at most, whereas Planning
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,860 [Speaker 2]
Commission is the more, um-- it's a little
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680 [Speaker 2]
more strict, where from fifty to eighty,
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,370 [Speaker 2]
it's always gonna be a CUP.
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,490 [Speaker 0]
Mm-hmm.
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,100 [Speaker 2]
So staff recommendations just removes the
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,880 [Speaker 2]
CUP option completely.
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,310 [Speaker 0]
Yeah.
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,460 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, I know, and the Planning Commission
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,540 [Speaker 1]
was rejecting that.
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,720 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, and they wanted to maintain CUP for
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,140 [Speaker 2]
kind of this-
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,950 [Speaker 1]
I mean, I guess, like, just-
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,460 [Speaker 2]
- medium large
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720 [Speaker 1]
... not to go into a whole big discussion,
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,440 [Speaker 1]
we just did that. I, I, I just- I'm
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,260 [Speaker 1]
trying to understand. I know right now,
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,370 [Speaker 1]
like, I'll just say, you know, right now
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,320 [Speaker 1]
we're suffering to get people in and
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,850 [Speaker 1]
reimagining what an eighty thousand square
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,940 [Speaker 1]
foot gap could possibly be. And so, you
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,840 [Speaker 1]
know, I don't know what the dangers are,
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,140 [Speaker 1]
what the real main concerns quickly are
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,140 [Speaker 1]
about, like, what would happen or what
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,100 [Speaker 1]
people are concerned about if we were to-
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,780 [Speaker 0]
Just to help, like, ground it a little bit
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,220 [Speaker 0]
for you, like, what does fifty thousand
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,220 [Speaker 0]
square feet look like, if that helps?
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,180 [Speaker 0]
It's, uh, think about the Bristol Farms
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,290 [Speaker 0]
Big Five combination up there. That's,
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,160 [Speaker 0]
like, forty-seven thousand-ish square
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,630 [Speaker 0]
feet. Gives you a s- sense of scale. Whole
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,100 [Speaker 0]
Foods on Wilshire and Twenty-Third,
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,320 [Speaker 0]
that's, like, a thirty thousand square
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,530 [Speaker 0]
foot-
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:43,530 [Speaker 1]
Mm
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,420 [Speaker 0]
... grocery store. Um, just to j- just to
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,320 [Speaker 0]
give you some, some grounding as to, you
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480 [Speaker 0]
know, what we're talking about. Um, I
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,560 [Speaker 0]
don't know that we have something that
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,770 [Speaker 0]
eighty thousand square feet. You know,
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080 [Speaker 0]
Santa Monica Place is five hundred
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,150 [Speaker 0]
thousand, right? So that's enormous. Um,
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,060 [Speaker 0]
so what this is, is between twenty-five to
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,020 [Speaker 0]
eighty, it's either permitted or it's a
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,600 [Speaker 0]
minor use permit. Minor use permit allows
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,090 [Speaker 0]
us to take into consideration some spite-
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,580 [Speaker 0]
site-specific considerations, particular
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,640 [Speaker 0]
to that location. In all cases, what we
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,420 [Speaker 0]
have seen with any retail is, like, when
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,980 [Speaker 0]
you have a large scale, imagine what if it
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,060 [Speaker 0]
was Costco or something, right? It's the
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,740 [Speaker 0]
parking, loading, and operations piece
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,370 [Speaker 0]
that is always the issue, 'cause it's
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,350 [Speaker 0]
always the logistics of how do you, you
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,200 [Speaker 0]
know, deliver, um, that, that kind of
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,490 [Speaker 0]
thing. Um, that, that's where we often
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,150 [Speaker 0]
spend most of the time, you know, looking
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,420 [Speaker 0]
at this. So that's why the staff
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,060 [Speaker 0]
recommendation was either minor use
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,080 [Speaker 0]
permit, um, or it's a per- outright
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,140 [Speaker 0]
permitted use, but you must have that
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,490 [Speaker 0]
parking, loading, and operations plan, um,
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760 [Speaker 0]
in order to mitigate, you know, what
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,490 [Speaker 0]
would be the greatest impact without going
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,260 [Speaker 0]
through this, like, massive CUP, um,
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280 [Speaker 0]
process. So-
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,880 [Speaker 1]
Right. So what are you losing in that
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,860 [Speaker 1]
process?
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,270 [Speaker 0]
What are you losing in that process? Um, I
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,890 [Speaker 0]
don't, I, I don't know that we could
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,230 [Speaker 0]
advocate for a CUP, because a CUP will
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,620 [Speaker 0]
still be required for eighty thousand
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,170 [Speaker 0]
square feet and above, which is very, you
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,860 [Speaker 0]
know, the, the sort of, like, mega stores
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,240 [Speaker 0]
of which we don't even have here.
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,250 [Speaker 1]
Right.
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,020 [Speaker 0]
Um, you know, so I thought we-
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,340 [Speaker 5]
... we, we felt that that MUP or permitted
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,920 [Speaker 5]
with plop was a reasonable compromise,
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,920 [Speaker 5]
sort of balancing the ability for
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,100 [Speaker 5]
community input, a public hearing, you
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,300 [Speaker 5]
know, still taking into account, um,
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,680 [Speaker 5]
you know, how we mitigate impacts, um,
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,100 [Speaker 5]
from-
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,190 [Speaker 6]
Right
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,360 [Speaker 5]
... a larger scale use.
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,040 [Speaker 6]
Well, in the spirit of, uh, economic
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,480 [Speaker 6]
recoveries, um, moving forward then with
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,060 [Speaker 6]
the staff recommendation.
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,120 [Speaker 7]
We have a second?
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,880 [Speaker 8]
I'll second.
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,140 [Speaker 7]
Great. Um, do people still wanna make co-
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,320 [Speaker 7]
okay, Council Member Hall, then Raskin,
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,080 [Speaker 7]
then Zwick, then Zernitzky. Okay, Hall,
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,600 [Speaker 7]
are you in?
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:42,569 [Speaker 8]
Yes, thank you. Uh, thank you, Mayor, um,
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880 [Speaker 8]
and thank you, Council Member Negrete, for
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,770 [Speaker 8]
the motion. Uh, okay, look, on the
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,800 [Speaker 8]
pawnshop issue, I'm willing to admit when
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,560 [Speaker 8]
I'm wrong, and I appreciate the additional
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,440 [Speaker 8]
background and history, uh, that I've
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,800 [Speaker 8]
learned since our last vote on this, so
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,560 [Speaker 8]
thank you for that. Um,
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,580 [Speaker 8]
I will keep it very brief. You know, when
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,820 [Speaker 8]
we talk about a renaissance agenda for our
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,680 [Speaker 8]
city, the Community Development
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,640 [Speaker 8]
Department is leading it, so thank you for
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,050 [Speaker 8]
that. Um, this is a, a great, uh,
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,840 [Speaker 8]
embodiment of what we're trying to do here
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,120 [Speaker 8]
and what we're trying to achieve, so
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,620 [Speaker 8]
thank you, um, and I'll be supporting the
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,420 [Speaker 8]
most, obviously.
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,200 [Speaker 7]
Raskin?
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,980 [Speaker 9]
Yeah, I echo the thanks. Uh, fantastic
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,580 [Speaker 9]
work all around. Um, I, I don't think it
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,610 [Speaker 9]
was covered in the four questions that
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,390 [Speaker 9]
were teed up here, but so I... As far as I
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840 [Speaker 9]
understand it, the original idea
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,540 [Speaker 9]
for bars was to downgrade that to an MUP,
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,860 [Speaker 9]
and the planning commission said, "No,
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,090 [Speaker 9]
we're gonna keep the CUP on that,"
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,840 [Speaker 9]
uh, and that's what's before us tonight.
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,750 [Speaker 9]
Um, I'd be curious to hear what my
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,570 [Speaker 9]
colleagues say.
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,700 [Speaker 9]
I, I'm inclined to go with staff's
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,250 [Speaker 9]
original recommendation for MUPs for that,
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,400 [Speaker 9]
uh, because it can still be appealed to
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,500 [Speaker 9]
the planning commission if folks have
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,620 [Speaker 9]
concerns. So if folks are in favor of
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,240 [Speaker 9]
that, I'd-
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,970 [Speaker 10]
Why are you doing that?
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,540 [Speaker 11]
I, w- I, I think I, I think I spoke to
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,340 [Speaker 11]
that a little in my questions. Uh, my only
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520 [Speaker 11]
concern is if it would delay this first
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,230 [Speaker 11]
reading in any way, 'cause I, I agree that
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,180 [Speaker 11]
I'd like to see that change. I just wanna
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,830 [Speaker 11]
make sure that we can pass this tonight.
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,040 [Speaker 9]
Yeah.
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,960 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, those would be pretty easy changes
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,660 [Speaker 2]
that we'd be able to make. So, so that
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,880 [Speaker 2]
could be passed tonight as a-
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,459 [Speaker 9]
Yeah.
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,520 [Speaker 5]
Okay. The way that the zoning ordinance is
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,210 [Speaker 5]
drafted...
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,350 [Speaker 5]
Well, I, yeah, the way the zoning
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,060 [Speaker 5]
ordinance is drafted, it would not be a
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,420 [Speaker 5]
difficult change. We could make it this
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,570 [Speaker 5]
evening. It would be brought back with
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,820 [Speaker 5]
that change for a second reading.
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,000 [Speaker 7]
Uh, great. Is that it?
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,420 [Speaker 11]
Oh, was it me? Sorry. Um, I just wanted to
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080 [Speaker 11]
just echo my colleagues. Uh, really
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,220 [Speaker 11]
excited about this. I think we are, you
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,280 [Speaker 11]
know, really leading the way in becoming,
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,290 [Speaker 11]
uh, uh, a city that's open for business,
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,400 [Speaker 11]
and, and I, I think, uh, as my colleague
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,420 [Speaker 11]
said, um, community development is really,
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520 [Speaker 11]
um, uh, leading a, a, a culture change in
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,060 [Speaker 11]
the city that we're really excited about.
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,000 [Speaker 11]
Uh, beyond that, um,
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,400 [Speaker 11]
I think, uh, you spoke, uh, Council Member
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,820 [Speaker 11]
Raskin spoke to one of the questions
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,000 [Speaker 11]
around, uh, MUP process for bars. Um,
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,780 [Speaker 11]
uh, the only other one that I wanted to
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,640 [Speaker 11]
pull up here, excuse me, uh, was just,
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,640 [Speaker 11]
uh... And I think you indicated it was
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,980 [Speaker 11]
already underway, but I'd like to just
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,200 [Speaker 11]
a, a- ask if we could include direction,
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,700 [Speaker 11]
uh, as well, that we, when we come back, I
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,320 [Speaker 11]
think perhaps in June or whenever it is,
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,060 [Speaker 11]
that we are planning with the next, um,
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,830 [Speaker 11]
perhaps set of revisions, that we look at
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,749 [Speaker 11]
the office campus restrictions and, uh,
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,320 [Speaker 11]
the trash room question, which I believe
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,170 [Speaker 11]
is already in process, but that was my
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,100 [Speaker 11]
only question, uh, additional comment.
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,060 [Speaker 7]
Great.
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,120 [Speaker 11]
If that's amenable to the, the makers.
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,920 [Speaker 6]
Yes.
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,400 [Speaker 8]
Yes.
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,380 [Speaker 6]
And then to include this amendment that we
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320 [Speaker 6]
just mentioned in the motion.
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,880 [Speaker 11]
Yes, thank you.
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,420 [Speaker 7]
Council Member Zwi- um, Zernitzky.
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,960 [Speaker 8]
Sorry, bef- before Council Member
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,850 [Speaker 8]
Zernitzky goes, um, city attorney, would
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,890 [Speaker 8]
you mind, uh-
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,170 [Speaker 5]
Excuse me
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,220 [Speaker 8]
... restating the specific amendment?
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,320 [Speaker 5]
Yes, so the specific amendment would be
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,820 [Speaker 5]
to, um, require not a CUP, but an MUP for
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,920 [Speaker 5]
bars in all locations, where, where bars
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,770 [Speaker 5]
are permitted.
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,340 [Speaker 8]
That is friendly to the seconder.
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,550 [Speaker 10]
S- so I just wanted to make sure I'm also
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,089 [Speaker 10]
understanding this. So policy question
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,600 [Speaker 10]
number four was, "Should non-conforming
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,430 [Speaker 10]
bar establishments in the, um, in the
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,610 [Speaker 10]
neighborhood commercial Main Street
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,079 [Speaker 10]
District be allowed to reopen if the
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,520 [Speaker 10]
establishment has been closed for more
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,480 [Speaker 10]
than 12 months?" Does that mean that, uh,
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,860 [Speaker 10]
non-conforming bar establishments in other
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,460 [Speaker 10]
areas that have been closed for more than
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,240 [Speaker 10]
12 months would also be allowed to open
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,780 [Speaker 10]
under an MUP, or is that, would that be
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,360 [Speaker 10]
something-
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,180 [Speaker 2]
The, yeah... Well, I guess under this
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,980 [Speaker 2]
direction, they would just follow the
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,840 [Speaker 2]
typical process. This is very targeted to
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,110 [Speaker 2]
just NC Main Street District.
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,220 [Speaker 10]
Okay, got it. So this is, this is a
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,700 [Speaker 10]
separate thing than-
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,040 [Speaker 2]
Right
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,640 [Speaker 10]
... putting bars to MUP-
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:52,650 [Speaker 2]
Exactly
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,920 [Speaker 10]
... places where it is already, in, to, to
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,560 [Speaker 10]
districts where it is already allowed.
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,220 [Speaker 2]
Right. So that's just kinda globally
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,980 [Speaker 2]
across the city where bars are allowed.
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,660 [Speaker 2]
Instead of going to a CUP, the direction
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,550 [Speaker 2]
is now amendment to make it an MUP.
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,320 [Speaker 10]
And to clarify, bars are allowed, I
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,590 [Speaker 10]
assume, in w- w- where are they allowed?
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,920 [Speaker 2]
Yeah, like pretty much all of our
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,600 [Speaker 2]
commercial districts, so downtown, the
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,380 [Speaker 2]
boulevards, Bergamot area, uh, office
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,120 [Speaker 2]
campus, the IC, I think even in the
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,040 [Speaker 2]
hospital districts, maybe. Um, so pretty
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,440 [Speaker 2]
much all of our commercial boulevards,
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,810 [Speaker 2]
just not in any of the residential
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,540 [Speaker 2]
districts.
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,060 [Speaker 10]
Yeah, which that, that tracks.
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,500 [Speaker 2]
Right.
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,300 [Speaker 10]
I don't think we want anybody to, to have
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,610 [Speaker 10]
a bar in their garage, um, at least not
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,520 [Speaker 10]
open to the public. Um,
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,760 [Speaker 10]
sorry, there was something.
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,040 [Speaker 10]
Oh, um, on that first question of the
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,940 [Speaker 10]
making it easier to have larger
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,940 [Speaker 10]
establishments, I'm super excited about
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,640 [Speaker 10]
that because I just saw that there is an
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,300 [Speaker 10]
Ikea that's gonna be opening in Culver
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,280 [Speaker 10]
City, and I would-
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,640 [Speaker 2]
Oh.
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,230 [Speaker 2]
Really?
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,540 [Speaker 10]
It's... Yeah, it's like the Costco's
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,050 [Speaker 10]
technically in Marina del Rey, not...
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,640 [Speaker 10]
Yeah, that one's a weird one. So I would
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,060 [Speaker 10]
love to have some sort of, um, you know,
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,320 [Speaker 10]
larger store, like Ikea or Costco, that's
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,380 [Speaker 10]
specific to Santa Monica. That, that would
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,360 [Speaker 10]
be fabulous, and hopefully, this will
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,737 [Speaker 10]
make it more-... uh, more easy to do. Um,
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:13,708 [Speaker 10]
yeah, no, I'm, I'm just so excited. Thank
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:15,628 [Speaker 10]
you so much for, for all the work on this,
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,438 [Speaker 10]
and, um, yeah, look forward to what's
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,148 [Speaker 10]
next.
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,788 [Speaker 7]
Okay, I just wanna say two second-- two
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,708 [Speaker 7]
things, but I know we're, we're ready to
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:26,348 [Speaker 7]
go to closed session. Um, I am so proud to
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,408 [Speaker 7]
be part of this city. You guys are
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:32,158 [Speaker 7]
totally stepping up in every way, and I
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:35,758 [Speaker 7]
just wanna say major, major thank you. Um,
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,968 [Speaker 7]
killing it. Really just appreciate you all
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,468 [Speaker 7]
so much. I just had to say that. Um,
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,328 [Speaker 7]
super excited about this. I, I mentioned
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:47,288 [Speaker 7]
at the beginning, I think economic
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:49,028 [Speaker 7]
recovery requires stability and
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,828 [Speaker 7]
predictability, and also we have to be
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:53,588 [Speaker 7]
competitive with our other, uh, amongst
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:56,338 [Speaker 7]
our other cities in the region. Um, and I,
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:58,128 [Speaker 7]
I do, uh, acknowledge the comments about
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,548 [Speaker 7]
cost. I think, you know, the next sixteen
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,378 [Speaker 7]
item is, is hopefully dealing with some of
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,988 [Speaker 7]
that. We, we obviously wanna reduce the
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,208 [Speaker 7]
cost of doing business here, but in terms
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,668 [Speaker 7]
of streamlining, um, you know, time is
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:11,248 [Speaker 7]
money. Super appreciate you guys
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:13,647 [Speaker 7]
creatively coming up with these options.
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:15,108 [Speaker 7]
Um, and I think we're trying to send a
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:17,628 [Speaker 7]
clear signal tonight to the entire region,
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,508 [Speaker 7]
Santa Monica is open for business,
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,838 [Speaker 7]
period. We are trying to remove every
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,838 [Speaker 7]
single artificial barrier that we can,
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:27,798 [Speaker 7]
period. Uh, we wanna compete regionally,
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,168 [Speaker 7]
and we are not trying to throw up any
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:31,828 [Speaker 7]
roadblocks. So I would just invite folks
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:34,448 [Speaker 7]
in the community, if you are seeing an
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,618 [Speaker 7]
issue, we wanna hear about it. Uh, and I
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,378 [Speaker 7]
see the staff nodding. Thank you, guys. I,
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:38,948 [Speaker 7]
I think, you know,
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,098 [Speaker 7]
I, um, I'm not opening a business on, on
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:43,748 [Speaker 7]
Main Street right now, so to the people
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:46,488 [Speaker 7]
that are, we wanna hear about it. Um, and
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,988 [Speaker 7]
so thank you, and this ordinance is so
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,788 [Speaker 7]
exciting, and I'm excited to make it
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:51,308 [Speaker 7]
permanent.
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:54,568 [Speaker 7]
Yes, go ahead.
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:55,848 [Speaker 10]
I remembered the other thing I wanted to
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:56,728 [Speaker 10]
say. So I, I
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:58,868 [Speaker 10]
just wanted to acknowledge that in the
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,218 [Speaker 10]
past, we've heard concerns from members of
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:03,488 [Speaker 10]
the public about having, uh, too many
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,758 [Speaker 10]
establishments that serve alcohol and, you
00:14:05,788 --> 00:14:07,828 [Speaker 10]
know, the, the accessibility of alcohol.
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,988 [Speaker 10]
But I just wanted to make sure that folks
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:14,328 [Speaker 10]
are aware that, um, especially nowadays,
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,648 [Speaker 10]
places that serve alcohol also serve a lot
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:19,008 [Speaker 10]
of non-alcoholic options because more and
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:21,528 [Speaker 10]
more people are choosing to abstain from
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:24,468 [Speaker 10]
alcohol or are choosing to, uh, drink less
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,508 [Speaker 10]
of it. Even folks who do drink alcohol
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,248 [Speaker 10]
will sometimes drink non-alcoholic
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,528 [Speaker 10]
beverages, like a mocktail or
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:34,068 [Speaker 10]
non-alcoholic beer. So we're just giving
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,658 [Speaker 10]
people more choices and
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,168 [Speaker 10]
promoting, uh, promoting opportunities for
00:14:40,228 --> 00:14:42,208 [Speaker 10]
new businesses within our city, is how
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,068 [Speaker 10]
I'm looking at it. So just wanted to make
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,928 [Speaker 10]
sure I made that point. Thank you.
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,308 [Speaker 7]
Awesome. Let's vote.
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:48,948 [Speaker 12]
Yes.
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,968 [Speaker 7]

Council Member Hall?
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:54,468 [Speaker 13]
Yes.
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:55,848 [Speaker 7]
Council Member Raskin?
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,308 [Speaker 14]
Yes.
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,508 [Speaker 7]
Mayor Pro Tem Schlik?
00:14:58,548 --> 00:14:59,648 [Speaker 11]
Yes.
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:00,608 [Speaker 7]
Council Member Snell?
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:01,048 [Speaker 15]
Yes.
00:15:01,648 --> 00:15:03,948 [Speaker 7]
Council Member Czarnespeck- Czarnorskaya?
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,008 [Speaker 1]
Yes.
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:06,728 [Speaker 7]
And Mayor Terosis.
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:08,328 [Speaker 16]
Yes.
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:10,128 [Speaker 7]
Okay.
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:10,138 [Speaker 12]
Okay,
00:15:10,848 --> 00:15:13,148 [Speaker 12]
so now we're moving on to 16A. It's
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,528 [Speaker 12]
request of Mayor Pro Tem Swick and Council
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,968 [Speaker 12]
Member Negrete that the furtherance of
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,788 [Speaker 12]
the city's economic revitalization
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,828 [Speaker 12]
strategy, the City Council direct the city
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,468 [Speaker 12]
manager and city attorney to analyze and
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,748 [Speaker 12]
present options for supporting retail to
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,658 [Speaker 12]
restaurant and hospitality
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,448 [Speaker 12]
conversations.
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:31,988 [Speaker 1]
So nobody's-
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,608 [Speaker 12]
Wanted to take the lead on this.
00:15:33,648 --> 00:15:36,677 [Speaker 1]
Can I-- Do you mind if I introduce it? Um,
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,017 [Speaker 1]
okay, so this is about continuing on what
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:41,498 [Speaker 1]
we were just talking about, activating
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,328 [Speaker 1]
retail space, removing unnecessary
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:46,468 [Speaker 1]
barriers for small businesses who wanna
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,068 [Speaker 1]
invest in Santa Monica. We've spent years
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,108 [Speaker 1]
talking about economic revitalization. Um,
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:54,328 [Speaker 1]
one of the clearest challenges we hear,
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,208 [Speaker 1]
especially downtown and along our
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,808 [Speaker 1]
commercial corridors, is that converting
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:00,148 [Speaker 1]
an existing retail space into a restaurant
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:02,628 [Speaker 1]
is really cost prohibitive. It's not just
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,768 [Speaker 1]
rent and wastewater fees, it's grease
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,658 [Speaker 1]
interceptors, ventilation, ADA upgrades,
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:10,758 [Speaker 1]
fire, life safety modifications, and these
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,528 [Speaker 1]
are legitimate requirements, but the
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:15,028 [Speaker 1]
cumulative cost can stop a project before
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:15,868 [Speaker 1]
it even begins.
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,208 [Speaker 1]
Um, a few years ago, I explored whether we
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,168 [Speaker 1]
could provide wastewater fee relief to
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:22,708 [Speaker 1]
existing restaurants, and I bring that up
00:16:22,768 --> 00:16:24,987 [Speaker 1]
because it was months of meeting with
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:27,608 [Speaker 1]
restaurants and hearing, um, the impacts
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,288 [Speaker 1]
of those wastewater fee, uh, per seat
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,128 [Speaker 1]
charges. And at the time, we were told
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,848 [Speaker 1]
that it wasn't a viable option under the
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,278 [Speaker 1]
current structure. So this item reflects
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:38,828 [Speaker 1]
some lessons learned, and instead of
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:41,048 [Speaker 1]
looking backwards, we're looking forwards,
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,818 [Speaker 1]
conversions and new investment, and
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:45,568 [Speaker 1]
asking: How can we design a targeted pilot
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:47,178 [Speaker 1]
that works within our legal fiscal
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:50,328 [Speaker 1]
framework? This item simply asks staffs to
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,518 [Speaker 1]
analyze options for a pilot program that
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,828 [Speaker 1]
could waive, defer, or reduce certain fees
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,128 [Speaker 1]
and provide targeted support for tenant
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,888 [Speaker 1]
improvements that unlock these
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,028 [Speaker 1]
conversions. We're not eliminating
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,248 [Speaker 1]
standards. We're not compromising safety.
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:04,877 [Speaker 1]
We're just exploring how to strategically
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:07,688 [Speaker 1]
lower barriers so that small operators can
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,628 [Speaker 1]
activate storefronts. Restaurants drive
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,828 [Speaker 1]
foot traffic, foot traffic drives retail,
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:15,328 [Speaker 1]
and retail drives our economic recovery.
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,188 [Speaker 1]
And if we're serious about this economic
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:20,048 [Speaker 1]
revitalization, we def- definitely need to
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,588 [Speaker 1]
make it easier, not harder, for
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,388 [Speaker 1]
entrepreneurs to say yes to Santa Monica.
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:27,008 [Speaker 1]
Um, and I just wanna say that I have been
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,228 [Speaker 1]
bringing to the city manager's office many
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:31,168 [Speaker 1]
of my own personal contacts and
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,608 [Speaker 1]
colleagues coming in to look at bringing
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:36,228 [Speaker 1]
their businesses here downtown, um, and in
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:38,648 [Speaker 1]
Santa Monica, and one of the biggest
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,548 [Speaker 1]
things is looking at turning these
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:42,728 [Speaker 1]
existing retail spaces into restaurants,
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:46,088 [Speaker 1]
and these fees create a huge roadblock.
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,988 [Speaker 1]
And I can tell you, there are folks that
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,408 [Speaker 1]
aren't even in the state of California
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,928 [Speaker 1]
that I know tonight personally are
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,198 [Speaker 1]
watching this meeting pertinent to this
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,588 [Speaker 1]
item. So I'm looking forward to the, um,
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,748 [Speaker 1]
analysis and discussion.
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,868 [Speaker 11]
There we go. Uh, yeah, I'll just echo, uh,
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:08,918 [Speaker 11]
Council Member Negrete. Um, we, we did
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:12,188 [Speaker 11]
amazing work tonight, um, in making it
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:13,588 [Speaker 11]
easier from a zoning and permitting
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:16,048 [Speaker 11]
perspective to create the kind of vitality
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:17,568 [Speaker 11]
that we're seeing. And, you know, when it
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,028 [Speaker 11]
comes to restaurants, um, and other
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,224 [Speaker 11]
hospitality uses, uh-... as mentioned, um,
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,164 [Speaker 11]
when you're converting a sort of b- blank
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:28,514 [Speaker 11]
box retail space, it's, it's expensive
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:30,344 [Speaker 11]
and complicated, and I think we just wanna
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,304 [Speaker 11]
be doing everything we can as a city, not
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:33,624 [Speaker 11]
just to make it legal, but make it
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:34,784 [Speaker 11]
feasible to have these kind of
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,444 [Speaker 11]
establishments. This is something I think
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:37,674 [Speaker 11]
the whole, you know, goal, the whole
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,164 [Speaker 11]
council shares. I think we even talked
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:40,744 [Speaker 11]
about this as possible direction when we
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:43,384 [Speaker 11]
talked about the sign, uh, program as a,
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,504 [Speaker 11]
as a use of revenues, um, when it comes to
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,224 [Speaker 11]
facilitating these kind of uses. So I see
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:48,584 [Speaker 11]
this as just consistent with what the
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,604 [Speaker 11]
whole council has been pushing for, and,
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:52,264 [Speaker 11]
uh, excited to kind of just add this to
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:54,164 [Speaker 11]
our arsenal as we really, uh, work to
00:18:54,204 --> 00:18:56,484 [Speaker 11]
revitalize, uh, this area.
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:57,904 [Speaker 7]
Councilor Muhl?
00:18:58,484 --> 00:18:59,694 [Speaker 8]
Yes, we'd like to move the item.
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:00,204 [Speaker 7]
Great.
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:00,514 [Speaker 17]
Yay!
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:03,464 [Speaker 6]
Second.
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:06,884 [Speaker 7]
All those in favor?
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:07,944 [Speaker 18]
Aye.
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,904 [Speaker 7]
Any opposed or abstain? No. Great. Um,
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,244 [Speaker 7]
City Attorney, do you want-- Or sorry,
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,944 [Speaker 7]
City, City Clerk, are you reading us into
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,184 [Speaker 7]
closed session?
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,274 [Speaker 6]
I'll get that. I'll come back. I'm just
00:19:18,274 --> 00:19:18,644 [Speaker 6]
getting it.
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:19,174 [Speaker 7]
Oh, um-
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:20,224 [Speaker 12]
Unlike you guys, I'm ready to get you out
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:20,704 [Speaker 12]
of here.
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,244 [Speaker 7]
We're ready for reading into closed
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,094 [Speaker 7]
session and just wanna confirm about
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:24,094 [Speaker 7]
whether-
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,414 [Speaker 12]
All right, so here's the, here's the
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:25,704 [Speaker 12]
closed-
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:25,714 [Speaker 7]
Yeah.
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:27,364 [Speaker 12]
Let me get them real quick. Okay, so the
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:30,304 [Speaker 12]
first one is existing litigation, and this
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:34,014 [Speaker 12]
is John Doe et al., and with a...
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:38,164 [Speaker 12]
Sorry, with a bunch of Do- John Does. I
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,004 [Speaker 12]
had this other one. Okay. Next, we have
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,324 [Speaker 12]
five B, and it's an existing litigation.
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:48,664 [Speaker 12]
It's the city versus ICSLP. Next, we have
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,984 [Speaker 12]
Edgar Espinoza versus the City. Then we
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:55,504 [Speaker 12]
have another existing litigation. It's the
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,364 [Speaker 12]
People of the State of California
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:00,404 [Speaker 12]
versus Saeed Farzan.
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:01,664 [Speaker 7]
Hmm.
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,824 [Speaker 12]
Then we have another existing litigation,
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:06,844 [Speaker 12]
is Pavilions Motel, Inc., versus the City
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:08,864 [Speaker 12]
of Santa Monica. Then we have
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:11,684 [Speaker 12]
a significant exposure litigation. It's
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:14,184 [Speaker 12]
one case. We have, um, a real estate
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:18,024 [Speaker 12]
negotiation. This is five G. It's two five
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:19,844 [Speaker 12]
six Santa Monica Pier,
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:23,744 [Speaker 12]
and Oliver Chi is the city manager. He
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,324 [Speaker 12]
will be negotiator of record, will be
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:32,704 [Speaker 12]
negotiating with Sean Ahos. Sorry. Um,
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:33,224 [Speaker 12]
California
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,924 [Speaker 12]
Roadhouse. Then we have five H, another
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:38,323 [Speaker 12]
real estate negotiation, and it's for two
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,224 [Speaker 12]
zero one nine and nineteen oh five Pico
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:41,924 [Speaker 12]
Boulevard,
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:44,764 [Speaker 12]
and Oliver Chi, city manager, will be the
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:48,624 [Speaker 12]
city's negotiator with Dennis Ryl- Rydler,
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:51,614 [Speaker 12]
and they'll be negotiating the terms and
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:53,744 [Speaker 12]
the payment for a lease. Then we have
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,564 [Speaker 12]
another one. It's another real estate, and
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,344 [Speaker 12]
it's twenty twenty Fourteenth Street,
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,754 [Speaker 12]
Santa Monica. Again, the city manager will
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,654 [Speaker 12]
be negotiating on the city's behalf with
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:04,084 [Speaker 12]
Thea-- I hope I'm not messing up her last
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,024 [Speaker 12]
name, Capicelli. And this is, um-- They'll
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:10,024 [Speaker 12]
be negotiating for terms for a payment of
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:13,284 [Speaker 12]
a lease. Then again, we have another one.
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:16,704 [Speaker 12]
It's five six hundred Rickenbacker Road,
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:20,133 [Speaker 12]
Bell, California, and the city-- and this
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:23,044 [Speaker 12]
is Salvation Army. And then finally, the
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:24,894 [Speaker 12]
last one we have is an existing
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,284 [Speaker 12]
litigation. It's Ferole Williams versus
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,844 [Speaker 12]
the City.
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:28,913 [Speaker 7]
Great.
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,064 [Speaker 12]
City attorney?
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,704 [Speaker 12]
So we estimate a return in ninety minutes,
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:35,744 [Speaker 12]
and there may be some report outs, so we
00:21:35,784 --> 00:21:37,524 [Speaker 12]
will need to reconvene for the report outs
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,034 [Speaker 12]
briefly.
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,604 [Speaker 7]
And is anyone gonna recuse themselves?
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,804 [Speaker 11]
Yes, I have, um... Excuse me, as I pull it
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:49,014 [Speaker 11]
up. Um, I will be recusing myself from
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,824 [Speaker 11]
item five F due to a potential conflict of
00:21:51,864 --> 00:21:53,624 [Speaker 11]
interest under Government Code Section
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:56,984 [Speaker 11]
eight seven one zero zero.
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,244 [Speaker 7]
Any other ones?
00:22:00,304 --> 00:22:02,514 [Speaker 8]
Yes, uh, Mayor and Clerk, I will be
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:05,694 [Speaker 8]
recusing myself from items five H, five I,
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,024 [Speaker 8]
and five J, due to a potential conflict
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,584 [Speaker 8]
of interest under Government Code Section
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,924 [Speaker 8]
eight seven one zero zero.
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:15,694 [Speaker 7]
Great, um, so we will be back in ninety
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:17,284 [Speaker 7]
minutes. That should be around eleven
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:19,464 [Speaker 7]
fifteen, and we'll maybe report out, so
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:21,014 [Speaker 7]
we're all returning back at that point.
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:22,834 [Speaker 18]
Wow.
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,784 [Speaker 7]
Oh, you're recusing, too?
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:25,804 [Speaker 18]
No, I'm not recusing-
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:25,814 [Speaker 7]
Oh.
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:27,164 [Speaker 18]
-but I'd like to, uh-
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:27,484 [Speaker 7]
Oh, yes
00:22:27,494 --> 00:22:28,394 [Speaker 18]
... make the adjournment in public now.
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,224 [Speaker 7]
Okay, that's a good idea.
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:29,334 [Speaker 18]
Okay.
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,954 [Speaker 7]
Okay, we're gonna do our adjournment now
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:32,564 [Speaker 7]
before we come back. Go ahead, Barry.
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:36,584 [Speaker 18]
Th- thank you, Mayor. Um, I would like to
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:38,413 [Speaker 18]
adjourn this public tonight's meeting in
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:41,864 [Speaker 18]
memory of Reverend Jesse L. Jackson Sr.,
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,794 [Speaker 18]
who passed away on February seventeenth,
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:45,634 [Speaker 18]
twenty twenty-six, at the age of
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,854 [Speaker 18]
eighty-four. Reverend Jackson was one of
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:48,894 [Speaker 18]
the most consequential
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:50,964 [Speaker 18]
civil rights leader of the last
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,584 [Speaker 18]
half-century. A close associate of Dr.
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,904 [Speaker 18]
Martin Luther King Jr., he carried forward
00:22:55,964 --> 00:22:58,384 [Speaker 18]
the fight for racial justice, voting
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,784 [Speaker 18]
rights, and economic fairness, and
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:03,904 [Speaker 18]
political inclusion. He was one of the
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:08,554 [Speaker 18]
original authors of DEI. Through Operation
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,734 [Speaker 18]
PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition, and
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,114 [Speaker 18]
through his historic presidential
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,214 [Speaker 18]
campaigns in nineteen eighty-four and
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,424 [Speaker 18]
nineteen eighty-eight, he expanded civil
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:18,404 [Speaker 18]
participation and gave voice to
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,054 [Speaker 18]
communities long excluded from power.
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,404 [Speaker 18]
His work also touched Santa Monica
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,044 [Speaker 18]
directly. In nineteen ninety-five, he
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,324 [Speaker 18]
visited the Santa Monica College, where he
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:30,504 [Speaker 18]
spoke in defense of affirmative action
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,344 [Speaker 18]
and encouraged students to engage fully in
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:35,934 [Speaker 18]
civic life. And in two thousand and
00:23:35,944 --> 00:23:38,124 [Speaker 18]
three, he stood with grocery workers in
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,124 [Speaker 18]
Santa Monica during the Bonds and Food for
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:44,644 [Speaker 18]
Last Strike, joining UFCW members
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:47,214 [Speaker 18]
on picket lines in support of fair wages
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:49,544 [Speaker 18]
and healthcare and protection for working
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:50,044 [Speaker 18]
families.
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,644 [Speaker 18]
Reverend Jackson believed deeply in
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:56,524 [Speaker 18]
solidarity, that students, workers, and
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,904 [Speaker 18]
communities all have a role in shaping
00:23:58,964 --> 00:23:59,204 [Speaker 18]
more
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:03,364 [Speaker 18]
justice society. His visits here reflected
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:06,764 [Speaker 18]
that belief. "Keep hope alive," "I am
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:08,664 [Speaker 18]
somebody," were statements that are
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:10,344 [Speaker 18]
inspired a generation
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:14,804 [Speaker 18]
and are-- could currently be used today.
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:17,104 [Speaker 18]
For his long-- for his lifelong commitment
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,314 [Speaker 18]
to civil rights, economic justice, and
00:24:19,364 --> 00:24:21,624 [Speaker 18]
democratic participation, I ask that we
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:24,014 [Speaker 18]
adjourn tonight's open meeting in memory
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,514 [Speaker 18]
of Reverend Jesse L. Jackson Sr. Thank
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:28,344 [Speaker 18]
you. Thank you.
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:29,704 [Speaker 7]
Thanks so much, Barry, and we'll see
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:31,664 [Speaker 7]
everyone back in ninety minutes.
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:34,694 [Speaker 16]
... We
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:53,734 [Speaker 16]
are back. It
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,394 [Speaker 16]
is eleven forty, and, uh, city attorney,
00:24:56,414 --> 00:24:58,234 [Speaker 16]
would you mind, uh, giving us a report out
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:59,534 [Speaker 16]
of closed session?
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,254 [Speaker 4]
Yes. All matters were heard with the
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:03,674 [Speaker 4]
following reportable actions taken. For
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,934 [Speaker 4]
item five C, the city council approved a
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:08,734 [Speaker 4]
settlement in Espinoza v. City, a personal
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,314 [Speaker 4]
injury case involving a claim the
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:12,014 [Speaker 4]
plaintiff was struck by a city maintenance
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:14,404 [Speaker 4]
vehicle. The city denies liability and
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:16,194 [Speaker 4]
does not admit fault, but agreed to settle
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:17,594 [Speaker 4]
for eight million dollars, and in
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,974 [Speaker 4]
exchange, plaintiff agreed to release all
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:22,114 [Speaker 4]
claims against the city, um, against the
00:25:22,174 --> 00:25:24,384 [Speaker 4]
city. Amounts exceeding the city's one
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:26,394 [Speaker 4]
million dollar self-insured retention
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,214 [Speaker 4]
policy will be paid by the city's excess
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:30,634 [Speaker 4]
insurer. The settlement was approved by a
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:31,934 [Speaker 4]
vote of seven to zero.
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:35,094 [Speaker 4]

settlement of a vote of seven, seven zero.

lawsuit filed by the city against the
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,084 [Speaker 4]

00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:50,114 [Speaker 4]
drug and other nuisance activity to occur
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:52,344 [Speaker 4]
on the property, and a lawsuit filed by
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:53,914 [Speaker 4]

00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:55,984 [Speaker 4]
challenging the city's revocation of the,
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,934 [Speaker 4]
of the owner's business license to operate
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,114 [Speaker 4]

Furley Williams v. City, a personal injury
00:26:50,674 --> 00:26:52,474 [Speaker 4]
case involving a claim that Williams was
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:54,034 [Speaker 4]
